This principle marks a\\ndeparture from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system\\nand causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and\\ntextbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic\\nidea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\\nboundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es will take us\\nsignificantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined\\nin the National Policy on Education (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to\\npursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given space,\\ntime and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the\\ninformation passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the\\nsole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites\\nof learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we\\nperceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed\\nbody of knowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change i n school routines and mode of\\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days\\nare actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation\\nwill also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at\\nschool a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus\\ndesigners have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring\\nand reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child\\npsychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance\\nthis endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for\\ncontemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups and activities requiring\\nhands-on experience.\\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T) appr eciates\\nthe hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this\\nbook. W e wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory gr oup in science and\\nmathematics, Pr ofessor J.V . Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book,\\nProfessor V .B. Bhatia for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers\\ncontributed to the development of this textbook. W e are grateful to their principals\\nfor making this possible. W e are indebted to the institutions and or ganisations\\nwhich have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and\\npersonnel. W e are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring\\nCommittee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education,Foreword\\n2018-19\\nMinistry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of\\nProfessor Mrinal Miri and Pr ofessor G.P . Deshpande, for their valuable time\\nand contribution.\\nAs an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous\\nimprovement in the quality of its pr oducts, NCER T welcomes comments\\nand suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and\\nrefinement.\\nDirector\\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\\n30 November 2007 Research and Trainingiv\\n2018-19\\nThis book is the outcome of the efforts of the textbook development committee\\nappointed by the NCER T. The committee met a few times to interact with one\\nanother to improve the draft. Then there was a review meeting in which many\\nexperts and practicing school teachers were invited to review the draft and suggest\\nimprovements.\\nBy and large we have stuck to the format of the Class VII book. By now famous\\ncharacters, Boojho and Paheli, have been used to make the text interactive. Attempt\\nhas been made to recall children’s own experiences and build concepts around\\nthem. This is designed to connect science that they study in the school with their\\neveryday life.\\nMany activities have been suggested to clarify concepts. Some of these activities\\nare so simple that children can perform them on their own. The requirement of the\\napparatus r equir\\ned for the activities is minimal. W e per formed all the activities\\nourselves to ensure that there was no difficulty in performing them in the school\\nsituation. The activities should also help children in developing skills such as\\npresentation of data in tabular and graphical forms, reasoning and drawing inference\\nfrom the given data.\\nThe language of the book has been kept as simple as possible. A large number of\\nphotographs, illustrations, cartoons, etc. have been included to make the book\\nattractive. To help teachers evaluate children effectively, a large number of exercises\\nhave been given at the end of each chapter . The teachers are encouraged to frame\\nadditional exercises to test children’s understanding. Some challenging exercises\\nhave also been devised for those children who would like to appear for the National\\nTalent Sear ch Examination conducted by the NCER T.\\nWe are conscious of the fact that ther e is a paucity of additional r eading material\\nfor children. W e have tried to addr ess this pr oblem by pr oviding non-evaluative\\nboxes . These boxes, in light orange, contain additional information, anecdotes,\\nstories, strange facts and other such interesting materials.\\nWe all know that children ar e mischievous and playful by natur e. Ther efore, in\\norder to prevent any untoward incident during the performance of the activities in\\nthe school or outside, necessary cautions, in magenta, have been inserted at various\\nplaces in the book.\\nTo prepare children to assume their roles as responsible citizens of tomorrow,\\nattempt has been made to sensitise them to the issues concer ning gender , religion,\\nenvir onment, health and hygiene, water scar city and ener gy conservation. W e have\\nsought to weave into the text the value of cooperation and the importance of peer\\nlearning.\\nAn important feature of the book is what we call Extended Learning . These are\\ntotally non-evaluative , and purely voluntary activities and projects. Some of the\\nprojects in this section have been designed to enhance children’s interaction with\\nthe experts, teachers, even parents, and society at large. The children are required\\nto collect information of various kinds and draw conclusions of their own.\\nMy request to teachers and parents is to use the book in the spirit in which it\\nhas been written. Encourage children to perform activities and learn by doing, rather\\nthan by r ote. Y ou can supplement, or even r eplace, the activities given her e. If youPreface\\n2018-19\\nfeel that you have better alter natives, especially with your local/r egional flavour ,\\nplease write to us so that these activities could be used in the future editions of\\nthe book.\\nWe have been able to include only a small subset of childr en’s experiences. Y ou\\nhave a better knowledge of their experiences because you are in touch with them.\\nUse them to illustrate the concepts being taught. Above all, please do not stifle\\nchildren’s natural curiosity. Encourage them to ask questions, even if sometimes\\nyou feel uncomfortable. If you do not know the answer to a question on the spot, do\\nnot feel embarrassed. Y ou can pr omise them to find the answer and deal with it\\nlater. Make a genuine attempt to get the answer fr om whatever r esour ces ar e within\\nyour reach, such as senior school or college teachers, experts, libraries, internet\\netc. If, inspite of your efforts, you cannot get the answer to some question, you could\\nwrite to NCER T.\\nI must thank the NCER T for enabling us to talk to childr en thr ough the medium\\nof this book. Every member of the NCER T has been courteous and helpful to us.\\nIn the end, I must express my gratitude to the members of the Editing Team,\\nwho worked tirelessly to help me bring the book to the present form. If you and your\\nstudents find this book useful and enjoy teaching/learning science through this\\nbook, the Editing Team and I shall consider ourselves well-rewarded.\\nV.B.

They love to ask questions. All kinds of questions come to their\\nminds and they collect them in their sacks. Sometimes, they may share some\\nof the questions with you, as you read through the chapters.\\nPaheli and Boojho are also on the lookout for answers to many\\nquestions — sometimes the questions seem answered after they discuss them\\nwith each other , sometimes thr ough discussions with other classmates, teachers\\nor their parents. Answers to some questions do not seem available even after\\nall these. They might need to experiment on their own, read books in the library,\\nsend questions to scientists. Just dig and dig and dig into all possibilities and\\nsee if the questions can be answered. Perhaps, they would carry some of the\\nunanswered questions in their sacks to higher classes.\\nWhat will really thrill them would be your adding questions to their sacks\\nor answers to their questions. Sometimes, activities are suggested in the\\ntextbook, results or findings of these by different groups of students would be\\nof inter est to other students and teachers. Y ou can complete the suggested\\nactivities and send your results or findings to Paheli and Boojho. Do keep in\\nmind that activities that involve using blades, scissors or fire need to be done\\nstrictly under the care of your teachers. Stick to the precautions given and\\nthen enjoy doing all the suggested activities. Mind, the book will not be able to\\nhelp you much, if the activities are not completed!\\nWe would like to advise you that you must make observations yourself\\nand record whatever results you get. Keen and true observations are necessary\\nfor exploring any subject of study. For some reason your results may turn out\\nto be dif ferent fr om those of your classmates. Do not worry. T ry to find out the\\nreason for these results instead of disregarding them.

Their uncle is a far mer\\n.\\nOne day they saw some tools like khurpi ,\\nsickle, shovel, plough, etc., in the field.\\nIn order to provide food for a large\\npopulation— regular production, proper\\nmanagement and distribution is\\nnecessary.\\n1.1Agricultural Practices\\nTill 10,000 B.C.E. people wer e\\nnomadic. They were wandering in\\ngroups from place to place in search\\nof food and shelter . They ate raw\\nfruits and vegetables and started\\nhunting animals for food. Later , they\\ncould cultivate land and produce rice,\\nwheat and other food crops. Thus,\\nwas born ‘Agriculture’.\\nWhen plants of the same kind are\\ncultivated at one place on a large scale,\\nit is called a crop. For example, crop of\\nwheat means that all the plants grown\\nin a field are that of wheat.\\nYou alr eady know that cr ops ar e of\\ndifferent types like cereals, vegetables\\nand fruits. These can be classified on the\\nbasis of the season in which they grow.\\nIndia is a vast country. The climatic\\nconditions like temperature, humidity\\nand rainfall vary from one region to\\nanother . Accor\\ndingly, ther e is a richYou have lear nt that all living\\norganisms require food. Plants can make\\ntheir food themselves. Can you recall\\nhow green plants synthesise their own\\nfood? Animals including humans can\\nnot make their own food. So, where do\\nanimals get their food from?\\nBut, first of all why do we have to eat\\nfood?\\nYou alr eady know that energy fr om\\nthe food is utilised by organisms for\\ncarrying out their various body\\nfunctions, such as digestion, respiration\\nand excretion. W e get our food fr om\\nplants, or animals, or both.\\nSince we all need food,\\nhow can we provide\\nfood to a large number\\nof people in our\\ncountry?Food has to be\\nproduced on a large\\nscale.\\nI want to know\\nwhere and how we\\nuse these tools.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 2variety of crops grown in different parts\\nof the country. Despite this diversity,\\ntwo broad cropping patterns can be\\nidentified. These are:\\n(i) Kharif Crops : The crops which are\\nsown in the rainy season are called\\nkharif crops. The rainy season in India\\nis generally fr om June to September .\\nPaddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and\\ncotton are kharif crops.\\n(ii) Rabi Crops : The crops grown in the\\nwinter season (October to March) are\\ncalled rabi crops. Examples of rabi\\ncrops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard\\nand linseed.\\nBesides these, pulses and vegetables\\nare grown during summer at many\\nplaces.\\n1.2Basic Practices of Crop\\nProductionto as agricultural practices  which are\\nlisted below:\\n(i)Preparation of soil\\n(ii)Sowing\\n(iii)Adding manure and fertilisers\\n(iv)Irrigation\\n(v)Protecting from weeds\\n(vi)Harvesting\\n(vii)Storage\\n1.3 Preparation of Soil\\nThe preparation of soil is the first step\\nbefore growing a crop. One of the most\\nimportant tasks in agriculture is to turn\\nthe soil and loosen it. This allows the\\nroots to penetrate deep into the soil. The\\nloose soil allows the roots to breathe\\neasily even when they go deep into the\\nsoil. Why does the loosening of soil allow\\nthe roots to breathe easily?\\nThe loosened soil helps in the growth\\nof earthworms and microbes present in\\nthe soil. These organisms are friends of\\nthe farmer since they further turn and\\nloosen the soil and add humus to it.\\nBut why the soil needs to be turned and\\nloosened?\\nYou have lear nt  in the pr evious\\nclasses that soil contains minerals,\\nwater , air and some living organisms.\\nIn addition, dead plants and animals\\nget decomposed by soil organisms. In\\nthis way, various nutrients in the dead\\norganisms are released back into the\\nsoil. These nutrients are again absorbed\\nby plants.\\nSince only a few centimetres of the\\ntop layer of soil supports plant growth,\\nturning and loosening of soil brings the\\nnutrient-rich soil to the top so that\\nplants can use these nutrients. Thus,Why  paddy can not be\\ngrown in the winter season?\\nPaddy requires a lot of\\nwater . Ther efore, it is gr own\\nonly in the rainy season.\\nCultivation of crops involves several\\nactivities undertaken by farmers over a\\nperiod of time. Y ou may find that these\\nactivities are similar to those carried out\\nby a gardener or even by you when you\\ngrow ornamental plants in your house.\\nThese activities or tasks are referred\\n2018-19\\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 3turning and loosening of soil is very\\nimportant for cultivation of crops.\\nThe process of loosening and turning\\nof the soil is called  tilling  or ploughing .\\nThis is done by using a plough. Ploughs\\nare made of wood or iron. If the soil is\\nvery dry, it may need watering before\\nploughing. The ploughed field may have\\nbig clumps of soil called crumbs. It is\\nnecessary to break these crumbs.\\nLevelling the field is beneficial for\\nsowing as well as for irrigation. Levelling\\nof soil is done with the help of a leveller .\\nSometimes, manure is added to the\\nsoil before tilling. This helps in proper\\nmixing of manure with soil. The soil is\\nmoistened before sowing.\\nAgricultural Implements\\nBefore sowing the seeds, it is necessary to\\nbreak soil clumps to get better yield. This\\nis done with the help of various tools.\\nThe main tools used for this purpose are\\nthe plough, hoe and cultivator .Plough :  This is being used since\\nancient times for tilling the soil, adding\\nfertili sers to the crop, removing the weeds\\nand turning the  soil. This is made of\\nwood and is drawn by a pair of bulls or\\nother animals  (horses and camels) . It\\ncontains a strong triangular iron strip\\ncalled ploughshare. The main part of the\\nplough is a long log of wood which is\\ncalled a ploughshaft. There is a handle\\nat one end of the shaft. The other end is\\nattached to a beam which is placed on\\nthe bulls’ necks. One pair of bulls and a\\nman can easily operate the plough\\n[Fig. 1.1 (a)].\\nThe indigenous wooden plough is\\nincreasingly being replaced by iron\\nploughs nowadays.\\nHoe : It is a simple tool which is used\\nfor removing weeds and for loosening\\nthe soil. It has a long rod of wood or\\niron. A strong, broad and bent plate of\\niron is fixed to one of its ends and\\nFig. 1.1 (a) :  \\nThe plough\\nploughshaft\\nploughsharebeam\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 4Activity 1.1\\nTake a beaker and fill half of it\\nwith water . Put a handful of wheat\\nseeds and stir well.  Wait for some\\ntime.\\nAre there seeds which float on\\nwater? W ould those be lighter or\\nheavier than those which sink? Why\\nwould they be lighter? Damaged seeds\\nbecome hollow  and ar e thus lighter .\\nTherefor\\ne, they float on water .\\nThis is a good method for\\nseparating good, healthy seeds from\\nthe damaged ones.\\nBefore sowing , one of the important\\ntasks is to know about the tools used\\nfor sowing seeds [Fig. 1.2 (a), (b)].\\nTraditional tool : The tool used\\ntraditionally for sowing seeds is\\nshaped like a funnel [Fig. 1.2 (a)]. The\\nseeds are filled into the funnel,\\npassed down through two or three\\npipes having sharp ends. These\\nends pierce into the soil and place\\nseeds there.Cultivator : Nowadays ploughing is\\ndone by tractor -driven cultivator . The\\nuse of cultivator saves labour and time.\\n[Fig. 1.1 (c)].\\nFig. 1.1 (b) : A hoe\\nFig. 1.2 (a) :  Traditional method of sowing\\nFig.  1.1 (c) :  Cultivator driven by a tractor\\n1.4 Sowing\\nSowing is an important part of crop\\nproduction. Before sowing, good quality,\\nclean and healthy seeds of a good\\nvariety —are selected. Farmers prefer to\\nuse seeds which give high yield.\\nSelection of Seedsgrip beam\\nbent plate\\nrodhandle\\nOne day I saw my mother put\\nsome gram seeds in a vessel\\nand pour some water on\\nthem. After a few minutes\\nsome seeds started to float\\non top. I wonder why some\\nseeds float on water!works like a blade. It is pulled by\\nanimals [Fig. 1.1 (b)].\\n2018-19\\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 5Seed drill :  Nowadays the seed drill [Fig.\\n1.2 (b)] is used for sowing with the help\\nof tractors. This sows the seeds\\nuniformly at equal distance and depth.\\nIt ensures that seeds get covered by the\\nsoil after sowing. This protects seeds\\nfrom being eaten by birds. Sowing by\\nusing a seed drill saves time and labour .Fig. 1.2 (b) :  A seed drill\\nThere is a nursery near my\\nschool. I found that little\\nplants were kept in small\\nbags. Why are they\\nkept like this?\\nSeeds  of a few plants\\nsuch as paddy are first\\ngrown in a nursery. When\\nthey grow into seedlings,\\nthey are transplanted to\\nthe field manually. Some\\nforest plants and flowering\\nplants are also grown in\\nthe nursery.\\nAppropriate distance between the\\nseeds is necessary to avoid overcrowding\\nof plants. This allows plants to get\\nI saw a healthy crop growing\\nin a farm. In the neighbouring\\nfarm, the plants were weak.\\nWhy do some plants grow\\nbetter than others?sufficient sunlight, nutrients and water\\nfrom the soil. At times a few plants\\nmay have to be removed to prevent\\novercrowding.\\n1.5Adding Manure  and\\nFertilisers\\nThe substances which are added to the\\nsoil in the form of nutrients for the\\nhealthy growth of plants are called\\nmanure\\n and fertilisers .\\nSoil supplies mineral nutrients to the\\ncrop plants. These nutrients are\\nessential for the growth of plants. In\\ncertain areas, farmers grow crop after\\ncrop in the same field. The field is never\\nleft uncultivated or fallow. Imagine what\\nhappens to the nutrients?\\nContinuous cultivation of crops\\nmakes the soil poor in nutrients.\\nTherefore, farmers have to add manure\\nto the fields to replenish the soil with\\nnutrients. This process is called\\nmanuring . Improper or insufficient\\nmanuring results in weak plants.\\nManure is an organic substance\\nobtained from the decomposition of\\nplant or animal wastes. Farmers dump\\nplant and animal waste in pits at open\\nplaces and allow it to decompose. The\\ndecomposition is caused by some\\nmicroorganisms. The decomposed\\nmatter is used as organic manure.\\nYou have alr eady lear nt about\\nvermicomposting in Class VI.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 6Activity 1.2\\nTake moong  or gram seeds and\\ngerminate them. Select three equal\\nsized seedlings . Take three empty\\nglasses or similar vessels. Mark them\\nA, B and C. To glass A add little\\namount of soil mixed with a little cow\\ndung manure. In glass B put the\\nsame amount of soil mixed with a\\nlittle urea. T\\nake the s ame amount\\nof soil in glass C without adding\\nanything [Fig. 1.3(a)]. Now pour the\\nsame amount of water in each glass\\nand plant the seedlings in them.\\nKeep them in a safe place and water\\nthem daily . After 7 to 10 days\\nobserve their growth [Fig. 1.3(b)].better growth of plants? In which glass\\nwas the growth fastest?\\nFertilisers are chemical s  which are\\nrich in a particular nutrient. How are\\nthey different from manure? Fertilisers\\nare produced in factories. Some\\nexamples of fertilisers are — urea,\\nammonium sulphate, super\\nphosphate, potash, NPK (Nitrogen,\\nPhosphorus, Potassium).\\nThe use of fertilisers has helped\\nfarmers to get  better yield of crops\\nsuch as wheat, paddy and maize. But\\nexcessive use of fertilisers has made\\nthe soil less fertile. Fertilisers have  also\\nbecome a source of water pollution.\\nTherefore, in order to maintain  the\\nfertility of the soil, we have to\\nsubstitute fertilisers with organic\\nmanure or leave the field uncultivated\\n(fallow) in between two crops.\\nThe use of manure improves soil\\ntexture as well as its water retaining\\ncapacity. It replenishes the soil with\\nnutrients.\\nAnother method of replenishing\\nthe soil with nutrients is through crop\\nrotation . This can be done by growing\\ndifferent crops alter nately.  Earlier ,\\nfarmers in northern India used to\\ngrow legumes as fodder in one season\\nand wheat in the next season. This\\nhelped in the replenishment of the soil\\nwith nitrogen. Farmers are being\\nencouraged to adopt this practice.\\nIn the previous classes, you have\\nlearnt about Rhizobium  bacteria.\\nThese are present in the nodules of\\nroots of leguminous plants. They fix\\natmospheric nitrogen.\\nFig. 1.3 (a) : Preparation of the experiment\\nDid  plants in all the glasses grow at\\nthe same pace?

W ater is absorbed by\\nthe plant r oots. Along with water ,\\nminerals and fertilisers are also\\nabsorbed. Plants contain nearly 90%\\nwater . Water is essential because\\ngermination of seeds does not take place\\nunder dry conditions. Nutrients\\ndissolved in water are transported to\\neach part of the plant. W ater alsoprotects the crop from both frost and\\nhot air currents. To maintain the\\nmoisture of the soil for healthy crop\\ngrowth, fields have to be watered\\nregularly.\\nThe supply of water to crops at\\nregular intervals is called irrigation . The\\ntime and frequency of irrigation varies\\nfrom crop to crop, soil to soil and season\\nto season. In summer , the fr equency of\\nwatering is higher . Why is it so? Could\\nit be due to the increased rate of\\nevaporation of water from the soil and\\nthe leaves?Table 1.1 : Differences between Fertiliser and Manure\\nS. No. Fertiliser Manure\\n1.

The main\\nmethods used are as follows:\\n(i)Sprinkler System: This\\nsystem is more useful on the\\nuneven land where sufficient\\nwater is not available. The\\nperpendicular pipes, having\\nrotating nozzles on top, are\\njoined to the main pipeline\\nat regular intervals. When\\nwater is allowed to flow\\nthrough the main pipe under pressure\\nwith the help of a pump, it escapes from\\nthe rotating nozzles. It gets sprinkled\\non the crop as if it is raining.\\nSprinkler is very useful for lawns, coffee\\nplantation and several other crops\\n[Fig. 1.5 (a)].\\nFig. 1.5 (b) :  Drip System\\nFig. 1.5 (a) :  Sprinkler system\\n(ii)Drip system : In this system, the\\nwater falls drop by drop directly near\\nthe roots. So it is called drip system. It\\nis the best technique for watering fruit\\nplants,  gardens and trees [Fig. 1.5(b)].\\nWater is  not wasted at all. It is a boon in\\nregions wher e availability of water is poor .\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 101.7 Pr otection fr om W eeds\\nBoojho and Paheli went to a nearby\\nwheat field and saw that there were some\\nother plants in the field, growing along\\nwith wheat plants.\\nHave these other\\nplants been planted\\npurposely?\\nIn a field many other undesirable\\nplants may grow naturally along with\\nthe crop. These undesirable plants are\\ncalled weeds .\\nThe removal of weeds is called\\nweeding. W eeding is necessary since\\nweeds compete with the crop plants for\\nwater , nutrients, space and light. Thus,\\nthey affect the growth of the crop. Some\\nweeds inter fere even in harvesting and\\nmay be poisonous for animals and\\nhuman beings.\\nFarmers adopt many ways to remove\\nweeds and contr ol their growth. T\\nilling\\nbefore sowing of crops helps in\\nuprooting and killing of weeds, which\\nmay then dry up and get mixed with\\nthe soil. The best time for the removal\\nof weeds is before they produce flowers\\nand seeds. The manual removal includes\\nphysical removal of weeds by uprooting\\nor cutting them close to the ground,\\nfrom time to time. This is done with the\\nhelp of a khurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)]\\nis also used to uproot weeds.\\nWeeds ar e also controlled by using\\ncertain chemicals, called weedicides ,\\nlike 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the\\nfields to kill the weeds. They do not\\ndamage the crops. The weedicides are\\ndiluted with water to the extent required\\nand sprayed in the fields with a sprayer .\\n(Fig. 1.6).\\nDo weedicides have any\\neffect on the person handling\\nthe weedicide sprayer?Fig. 1.6 : Spraying weedicide\\nAs already mentioned, the  weedicides\\nare sprayed during the vegetative growth\\nof weeds before flowering and seed\\nformation. Spraying of weedicides may\\naffect the health of  farmer s. So they\\nshould use these chemicals very carefully.\\nThey should cover their nose and mouth\\nwith a piece of cloth during spraying of\\nthese chemicals.\\n1.8Harvesting\\nHarvesting of a crop is an important\\ntask. The cutting of crop after it is\\nmature is called harvesting . In\\nharvesting, crops are pulled out or cut\\nclose to the ground. It usually takes 3\\nto 4 months for a cereal crop to mature.\\nHarvesting in our\\ncountry is either done\\nmanually by sickle\\n(Fig. 1.7) or by a machine\\ncalled harvester . In the\\nharvested crop, the grain\\nseeds need to be separatedFig. 1.7 :\\nSickle\\n2018-19\\nCROP PRODUCTION  AND MANAGEMENT 11from the chaff. This process is called\\nthreshing . This is carried out with the\\nhelp of a machine called ‘combine’ which\\nis in fact a  harvester as well as a  thresher\\n(Fig. 1.8).\\nFig. 1.8 :  Combine\\nAfter harvesting, sometimes\\nstubs are left in the field, which\\nare burnt by farmers. Paheli is\\nworried. She knows that it\\ncauses pollution. It may also\\ncatch fire and damage the crops\\nlying in the fields.\\nHarvest Festivals\\nAfter three or four months of hard\\nwork there comes the day of the\\nharvest. The sight of golden fields\\nof standing crop, laden with grain,\\nfills the hearts of farmers with joy\\nand a sense of well -being. The\\nefforts of the past season have\\nborne fruit and it is time to relax\\nand enjoy a little. The period of\\nharvest is, thus, of great joy and\\nhappiness in all parts of India.\\nMen and women celebrate it with\\ngreat enthusiasm. Special\\nfestivals associated with the\\nharvest season are Pongal,\\nBaisakhi, Holi, Diwali, Nabanya\\nand Bihu.\\n1.9Storage\\nStorage of produce is an important task.\\nIf the harvested grains are to be kept\\nfor longer time, they should be safe\\nfrom moisture, insects, rats and\\nmicroorganisms. Harvested grains have\\nmore moisture. If freshly harvested\\ngrains (seeds) are stored without drying,\\nthey may get spoilt or attacked by\\norganisms, making them unfit for use\\nor for  germination. Hence, before\\nstoring them, the grains are properly\\ndried in the sun to reduce the moisture\\nin them. This prevents the attack by\\ninsect pests, bacteria and fungi.Farmers with small holdings of land\\ndo the separation of grain and chaff by\\nwinnowing (Fig. 1.9).

However ,\\nthere are other living organisms\\naround us which we normally cannot\\nsee. These are called microorganisms\\nor\\n microbes . For example, you might\\nhave observed that during the rainy\\nseason moist bread gets spoilt and its\\nsurface gets cover ed with gr eyish white\\npatches. Observe these patches through\\na magnifying glass. Y ou will see tiny,\\nblack rounded structures. Do you know\\nwhat these structures are and where d o\\nthese come from?\\n2.1 Microorganisms\\nActivity 2.1\\nCollect some moist soil from the\\nfield in a beaker and add water to\\nit.

They are\\nalso used to control many plant\\ndiseases.\\nIt is important to remember that\\nantibiotics should be taken only on\\nthe advi ce of a qualified doctor . Also\\nyou must complete  the course\\nprescribed by the doctor . If you take\\nantibiotics when not needed or in\\nwrong doses, it may make the drug\\nless effective when you might need\\nit in future.

Y ou will find that plant\\nwaste  in pot A, has been decomposed.\\nHow did this happen? The plant waste\\nhas been converted into manure by the\\naction of microbes. The nutrientsreleased in the process can be used by\\nthe plants again.\\nDid you notice that in pot B , the\\npolythene bags, empty glasses, bottles\\nand broken toy parts did not undergo\\nany such change? The microbes could\\nnot ‘act’ on them and convert them into\\nmanure.\\nYou often see lar ge amounts of\\ndead organic matter in the form of\\ndecaying plants and sometimes dead\\nanimals on the gr\\nound. You find\\nthat they disappear after some time.\\nThis is because the microorganisms\\ndecompose dead organic waste of plants\\nand animals converting them into\\nsimple substances. These substances\\nare again used by other plants and\\nanimals.  Thus, microorganisms can\\nbe used to degrade the harmful and\\nsmelly substances and thereby clean\\nup the environment.\\n2.4Harmful Microorganisms\\nMicroorganisms are harmful in many\\nways.

They can also get\\ntransmitted by direct contact with an\\ninfected person or carried by an animal.\\nMicrobial diseases that can spread from\\nan infected person to a healthy person\\nthrough air , water , food or physical\\ncontact are called communicable\\ndiseases . Examples of such diseases\\ninclude cholera, common cold, chicken\\npox and tuberculosis.\\nWhen a person suffering from\\ncommon cold sneezes, fine droplets of\\nmoisture carrying thousands of viruses\\nare spread in the air . The virus may enter\\nthe body of a healthy person while\\nbreathing and cause infection.There are some insects and animals\\nwhich act as carriers  of disease-\\ncausing microbes. Housefly is one such\\ncarrier . The flies sit on the garbage and\\nanimal excreta. Pathogens stick to their\\nbodies. When these flies sit on uncovered\\nfood they may transfer the pathogens.\\nWhoever eats the contaminated food is\\nlikely to get sick. So, it is advisable to\\nalways keep food covered. Avoid\\nconsuming uncovered items of food.\\nAnother example of a carrier is the\\nfemale Anopheles  mosquito (Fig. 2.8),\\nwhich carries the parasite of malaria\\n(Plasmodium).

W e\\nhave to save it from the attack of\\nmicroorganisms.\\nChemical Method\\nSalts and edible oils are the common\\nchemicals generally used to check the\\ngrowth of microorganisms. Therefore\\nthey ar e called preservatives\\n. We add\\nsalt or acid preservatives to pickles to\\nprevent the attack of microbes. Sodium\\nbenzoate and sodium metabisulphite are\\ncommon preservatives. These are also\\nused in jams and squashes to check\\ntheir spoilage .\\nPreservation by Common Salt\\nCommon salt has been used to preserve\\nmeat and fish for ages. Meat and fish\\nare covered with dry salt to check\\nthe growth of bacteria. Salting is also\\nused to preserve amla, raw mangoes,\\ntamarind, etc.\\nPreservation by Sugar\\nJams, jellies and squashes are preserved\\nby sugar . Sugar r educes the moistur e\\ncontent which inhibits the growth of\\nbacteria which spoil food.\\nPreservation by Oil and Vinegar\\nUse of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage\\nof pickles because bacteria cannot live\\nin such an envir onment. V egetables,\\nfruits, fish and meat are often preserved\\nby this method.\\nHeat and Cold Treatments\\nYou must have observed your mother\\nboiling milk before it is stored or used.\\nBoiling kills many microorganisms.Similarly, we keep our food in the\\nrefrigerator . Low temperatur e inhibits\\nthe growth of microbes.\\nPasteurised milk can be consumed\\nwithout boiling as it is free from harmful\\nmicrobes. The milk is heated to about\\n700C for 15 to 30 seconds and then\\nsuddenly chilled and stored. By doing\\nso, it prevents the growth of microbes.\\nThis process was discovered by Louis\\nPasteur . It is called pasteurisation .\\nStorage and Packing\\nThese days dry fruits and even\\nvegetables are sold in sealed air tight\\npackets to prevent the attack of\\nmicrobes.\\n2.6Nitrogen Fixation\\nYou have lear nt about the bacterium\\nRhizobium   in Classes VI and VII. It is\\ninvolved in the  fixation of nitrogen in\\nleguminous plants (pulses). Recall that\\nRhizobium  lives in the root nodules of\\nleguminous plants  (Fig. 2.9), such as\\nbeans and peas, with which it has a\\nsymbiotic relationship. Sometimes\\nnitrogen gets fixed through the action\\nof lightning. But you know that the\\namount of nitrogen in the atmosphere\\nremains constant. Y ou may wonder\\nhow? Let us understand this in the next\\nsection.\\nWhy does the milk that\\ncomes in packets not spoil?\\nMy mother told me that the\\nmilk is ‘pasteurised’. What\\nis pasteurisation?\\n2018-19\\nMICROORGANISMS  : FRIEND AND FOE 27nitrogen cannot be taken directly by\\nplants and animals. Certain bacteria and\\nblue green algae  present in the soil fix\\nnitrogen from the atmosphere and\\nconvert it into compounds of nitrogen.\\nOnce nitrogen is converted into these\\nusable compounds, it can be utilised by\\nplants from the soil through their root\\nsystem. Nitrogen is then used for the\\nsynthesis of plant proteins and other\\ncompounds. Animals feeding on plants\\nget these proteins and other nitrogen\\ncompounds (Fig. 2.10).\\nWhen plants and animals die,\\nbacteria and fungi present in the soil\\nconvert the nitrogenous wastes into\\nnitrogenous compounds to be used by\\nplants again.

Fabrics\\nare made from fibres obtained\\nfrom natural or artificial sources. Can\\nyou name some natural fibres? Fibres\\nare also used for making a large variety\\nof household articles. Make a list of some\\ncommon articles made fr om fibr es. Try\\nto separate them into those made from\\nnatural fibres and those made from\\nartificial fibres. Make entries in Table 3.1.\\nWhy did you label some fibres as\\nartificial?\\nYou have r ead in your pr evious\\nclasses that natural fibres like cotton,\\nwool, silk, etc., are obtained from plants\\nor animals. The synthetic fibres, on the\\nother hand, are made by human beings.\\nThat is why these are called synthetic\\nor man-made  fibres.3.1What are Synthetic\\nFibres?\\nTry to r ecall the unifor m patter n found\\nin a necklace of beads joined with the\\nhelp of a thr ead [Fig. 3.1(a)].

No. Name of Type of Fibre\\nArticle (Natural/\\nartificial)\\nA synthetic fibre is also a chain of\\nsmall units joined together . Each small\\nunit is actually a chemical substance.\\nMany such small units combine to form\\na large single unit called a polymer . The\\nword ‘polymer’ comes from two Greek\\nwords; poly meaning many\\n and mer\\nmeaning part/unit. So,  a polymer is made\\nof many repeating units.\\n2018-19\\nPolymers occur in nature also. Cotton,\\nfor example, is a polymer called\\ncellulose . Cellulose is made up of a\\nlarge number of glucose units.\\n3.2Types of Synthetic Fibres\\nRayon\\nYou have r ead in Class VII that silk fibr e\\nobtained from silkworm was discovered\\nin China and was kept as a closely\\nguarded secret for a long time. Fabric\\nobtained from silk fibre was very costly.\\nBut its beautiful texture fascinated\\neverybody. Attempts were made to make\\nsilk artificially. Towards the end of the\\nnineteenth century, scientists were\\nsuccessful in obtaining a fibre having\\nproperties similar to that of silk. Such a\\nfibre was obtained by chemical\\ntreatment of wood pulp. This fibre was\\ncalled rayon or artificial silk .  Although\\nrayon is obtained from a natural source,\\nwood pulp, yet it is a man-made fibre. It\\nis cheaper than silk and can be woven\\nlike silk fibres. It can also be dyed in a\\nwide variety of colours. Rayon is mixed\\nwith cotton to make bed sheets or mixed\\nwith wool to make carpets. (Fig. 3.2.)Nylon\\nNylon  is another man-made fibre. In\\n1931, it was made without using any\\nnatural raw material (from plant or\\nanimal). It was prepared from coal, water\\nand air . It was the first fully synthetic\\nfibre.\\nNylon fibre was strong, elastic and\\nlight. It was lustrous and easy to wash.\\nSo, it became very popular for making\\nclothes.\\nWe use many articles made fr om\\nnylon, such as socks, ropes, tents,\\ntoothbrushes, car seat belts, sleeping\\nbags, curtains, etc. (Fig. 3.3).

It is\\nused for making bottles, utensils, films,\\nwires and many other useful products.\\nLook around and make a list of\\nthings made of polyester .\\nPolyester (Poly+ester) is actually made\\nup of the repeating units of a chemical\\ncalled an ester . Esters ar e the\\nchemicals which give fruits their smell.\\nFabrics are sold by names like polycot,\\npolywool, terrycot , etc. As the name\\nsuggests, these are made by mixing two\\ntypes of fibres. Polycot is a mixture of\\npolyester and cotton. Polywool is a\\nmixture of polyester and wool.\\nWe wear sweaters and use shawls\\nor blankets in the winter . Many of these\\nare actually not made from natural\\nwool, though they appear to resemble\\nwool. These are prepared from another\\ntype of synthetic fibre called  acrylic\\n.\\nThe wool obtained from natural\\nsources is quite expensive, whereas\\nclothes made from acrylic are relatively\\ncheap. They are available in a variety\\nof colours. Synthetic fibres are\\nmore durable and affordable which\\nmakes them more popular than\\nnatural fibres.You have alr eady per formed an\\nactivity of burning natural and\\nsynthetic fibres (Activity 3.6 of Class\\nVII). What did you observe? When you\\nburn synthetic fibres you find that\\ntheir behaviour is different from\\nthat of the natural fibres. Y ou must\\nhave noticed that synthetic fibres\\nmelt on heating. This is actually a\\ndisadvantage of synthetic fibres. If the\\nclothes catch fire, it can be disastrous.\\nThe fabric melts and sticks to the body\\nof the person wearing it.

Such plastic which\\ngets deformed easily on heating and\\ncan be bent easily are known as\\nthermoplastics. Polythene and PVC are\\nsome of the examples of thermoplastics.\\nThese are used for manufacturing toys,\\ncombs and various types of containers.\\nOn the other hand, there are some\\nplastics which when moulded once, can\\nnot be softened by heating. These are\\ncalled thermosetting  plastics.  Two\\nexamples are bakelite and melamine.\\nBakelite is a poor conductor of heat and\\nelectricity. It is used for making\\nelectrical switches, handles of various\\nutensils, etc. Melamine is a versatile\\nmaterial. It resists fire and can tolerate\\nheat better than other plastics.

It follows definite rules\\nbased on facts. And the rule here isthat zinc is more reactive than copperand iron. A more reactive metal canreplace a less reactive metal, but a lessreactive one cannot replace a morereactive metal. Now you canunderstand why there are nodisplacement reactions in beakers Dand E also. Can you guess thesequence of metals from more reactiveto less reactive among zinc, iron andcopper?\\n4.3 Uses of Metals and\\nNon-metals\\nYou should be able to guess why metalsare used in making machinery,automobiles, aeroplanes, trains,satellites, industrial gadgets, cookingutensils, water boilers, etc. You are alsofamiliar with the uses of some non-metals. Here are some interesting ones.We are sur e that you will guess them\\nright:\\n\\uf06cNon-metal is essential for our lifewhich all living beings inhale duringbreathing,\\n\\uf06cNon-metals used in fertilisers toenhance the growth of plants,\\n\\uf06cNon-metal used in water purificationprocess,\\n\\uf06cNon-metal used in the purplecoloured solution which is appliedon wounds as an antiseptic,\\n\\uf06cNon-metals used in crackers.\\nYou may add some mor e uses of\\nmetals and non-metals from  your\\nexperiences.What changes do you observe in the\\nvarious beakers? Y ou have r ead that one\\nmetal displaces another metal from its\\ncompound in aqueous solution. Inbeaker ‘A’ zinc (Zn) replaces copper (Cu)\\nfrom copper sulphate (CuSO\\n4). That is\\nwhy the blue colour of copper sulphate\\ndisappears and a powdery red mass ofcopper is deposited at the bottom of thebeaker . The r eaction can be represented\\nas follows:\\nCopper Sulphate (CuSO\\n4) + Zinc (Zn)\\n             (Blue)\\n→ Zinc Sulphate (ZnSO4) + Copper (Cu)\\n(Colourless)                      (Red)\\nYou can write down the r eaction\\ntaking place in beaker ‘B’ in a similar\\nmanner.\\nI have understood the reactions\\ntaking place in beakers ‘A’ and\\n‘B’. But I am still confused why\\nthere is no change in  beakers\\n‘C’, ‘D’ and ‘E’?\\nThere could have been displacement\\nof zinc by copper in beaker ‘C’ and by\\niron in beaker ‘E’. Similarly iron could\\nbe displaced by copper in beaker ‘D’.\\nSince we do not see any change in\\nbeaker C, we can infer that copper is\\nnot able to replace zinc from zincsulphate.  But why? When zinc canreplace copper in beaker ‘A’ why\\ncannot copper replace zinc in beaker‘C’? Remember that science is not\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 52I heard that magnesium is\\nfound in plants. In what\\nform is it found in them?\\nThe doctor reported iron\\ndeficiency in my body.\\nWhere is iron in my body?\\nIn Class VII, you have learnt that in a chemical reaction, new substances are\\nformed. These substances are different from those which underwent the reaction.Now, if a substance cannot be broken down further by chemical reactions, bycooling, heating, or by electrolysis, it is called ‘element’. Sulphur is an element.So is iron. Carbon, too, is an element. The smallest unit of an element is atom. Asample of an element contains only one kind of atom. The atom of an elementremains unaffected by physical changes in the element. For example, an atom ofliquid sulphur would be exactly the same as the atom of solid or vapour sulphur.\\nAlthough we have an infinite variety of substances in the universe, the number\\nof elements forming these substances is limited. There are no more than 94naturally occurring elements. An important classification of elements is in termsof metals and non-metals. Most of the elements are metals. The remaining areeither non-metals or metalloids. Metalloids possess character of both metals and\\nnon-metals.\\n2018-19\\nMATERIALS  : M ETALS AND NON-METALS 53\\n\\uf020\\uf020\\uf020 \\uf020\\uf020\\uf04b\\uf045\\uf059\\uf057\\uf04f\\uf052\\uf044\\uf053\\uf04b\\uf045\\uf059\\uf057\\uf04f\\uf052\\uf044\\uf053\\uf04b\\uf045\\uf059\\uf057\\uf04f\\uf052\\uf044\\uf053\\uf04b\\uf045\\uf059\\uf057\\uf04f\\uf052\\uf044\\uf053\\uf04b\\uf045\\uf059\\uf057\\uf04f\\uf052\\uf044\\uf053\\nATOM\\nCONDUCTOR\\nDISPLACEMENT\\nREACTION\\nDUCTILITY\\nELEMENTS\\nHARDNESS\\nMALLEABILITY\\nMETALS\\nMETALLOIDS\\nNON-MET ALS\\nSONOROUS\\uf020\\uf057\\uf048\\uf041 \\uf020\\uf057\\uf048\\uf041\\uf020\\uf057\\uf048\\uf041 \\uf020\\uf057\\uf048\\uf041\\uf020\\uf057\\uf048\\uf041\\uf054\\uf020\\uf059 \\uf054\\uf020\\uf059\\uf054\\uf020\\uf059 \\uf054\\uf020\\uf059\\uf054\\uf020\\uf059\\uf04f\\uf055\\uf020\\uf048\\uf041 \\uf04f\\uf055\\uf020\\uf048\\uf041\\uf04f\\uf055\\uf020\\uf048\\uf041 \\uf04f\\uf055\\uf020\\uf048\\uf041\\uf04f\\uf055\\uf020\\uf048\\uf041\\uf056\\uf045\\uf020\\uf04c\\uf045\\uf041\\uf052\\uf04e\\uf054\\uf056\\uf045\\uf020\\uf04c\\uf045\\uf041\\uf052\\uf04e\\uf054\\uf056\\uf045\\uf020\\uf04c\\uf045\\uf041\\uf052\\uf04e\\uf054\\uf056\\uf045\\uf020\\uf04c\\uf045\\uf041\\uf052\\uf04e\\uf054\\uf056\\uf045\\uf020\\uf04c\\uf045\\uf041\\uf052\\uf04e\\uf054\\n\\uf0dcMetals are lustrous whereas non-metals have\\nno lustre.\\n\\uf0dcGenerally, metals are malleable and ductile.\\nNon-metals do not have these properties.\\n\\uf0dcGenerally, metals are good conductors of heatand electricity but non-metals are poorconductors.\\n\\uf0dcOn burning, metals react with oxygen toproduce metal oxides which are basic innature.

It may be that the earlier\\ngenerations in some groups were\\nconcerned about the coming\\ngeneration(s)  and left something for\\nthem.\\nIn this chapter we will learn about\\nsome exhaustible natural resources\\nlike coal, petroleum and natural gas.\\nThese were formed from the dead\\nremains of living organisms (fossils).\\nSo, these are all known as fossil\\nfuels.5.1 Coal\\nYou may have seen coal or hear d about\\nit (Fig. 5.1). It is as hard as stone and is\\nblack in colour .\\nFig. 5.1: Coal\\nCoal is one of the fuels used \\nto cook\\nfood. Earlier , it was used in railway\\nengines to produce steam to run the\\nengine.

Coal is also\\nused as a fuel in various industries.\\nStory of Coal\\nWhere do we get\\ncoal from and how\\nis it formed?\\nAbout 300 million years ago the\\nearth had dense forests in low lying\\nwetland areas. Due to natural processes,\\nlike flooding, these forests got buried\\nunder the soil. As more soil deposited\\nover them, they were compressed. The\\ntemperature also rose as they sank\\ndeeper and deeper . Under high pr essur e\\nand high temperature, dead plants got\\nslowly converted to coal. As coal\\ncontains mainly carbon, the slow\\nprocess of conversion of dead vegetation\\ninto coal is called carbonisation. Since\\nit was formed from the remains of\\nvegetation, coal is also called a fossil fuel.\\nA coal mine is shown in Fig. 5.2.\\nCOAL AND PETROLEUM 57\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 58\\nFig. 5.2:  A coal mine\\nCoal Gas\\nCoal gas is obtained during the\\nprocessing of coal to get coke.

Similarly, you will\\nfind many other materials burning\\nwithout a flame.

The\\nsubstance that undergoes combustion\\nis said to be combustible. It is also called\\na fuel. The fuel may be solid, liquid or\\ngas.

What\\nhappens in the three cases? Does\\nthe flame flicker off? Does it flicker\\nand give  smoke? Does it burn\\nunaffected? Can you infer anything\\nat all about the role played by air in\\nthe process of burning?\\nWe find that for combustion, air is\\nnecessary. The candle burns freely in\\ncase (a) when air can enter the\\nchimney from below. In case (b), when\\nair does not enter the chimney from\\nbelow, the flame flickers and produces\\nsmoke. In case (c), the flame finally\\ngoes off because the air is not\\navailable.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 66Activity  6.3\\nPlace a piece of burning wood or\\ncharcoal on an iron plate or Tawa\\n.\\nCover it with a glass jar or a\\ntumbler , or a transparent plastic jar .\\nObserve what happens.

Can you guess why?\\n2018-19\\nCOMBUSTION  AND FLAME 67We find that a combustible substance\\ncannot catch fire or burn as long as its\\ntemperature is lower than its ignition\\ntemperature. Have you ever seen\\ncooking oil catching fire when a frying\\npan is kept for long on a burning stove?\\nKerosene oil and wood do not catch fire\\non their own at room temperature. But,\\nif kerosene oil is heated a little, it will\\ncatch fire. But if wood is heated a little,\\nit would still not catch fire. Does it mean\\nthat ignition temperature of kerosene oil\\nis lower than that of wood? Does it mean\\nthat we need to take special care in\\nstoring kerosene oil? The following\\nactivity shows that it is essential for a\\nsubstance to reach ignition temperature\\nto burn.\\nActivity 6.4\\n(Caution : Be careful while handling\\nburning candle).\\nMake two paper cups by folding a\\nsheet of paper . Pour about 50 mL of\\nwater in one of the cups. Heat both\\nthe cups separately with a candle\\n(Fig. 6.5). What do you observe?The history of the matchstick is very\\nold. More than five thousand years\\nago small pieces of pinewood dipped\\nin sulphur were used as matches in\\nancient Egypt. The modern safety\\nmatch was developed only about two\\nhundred years ago.\\nA mixture of antimony trisulphide,\\npotassium chlorate and white\\nphosphorus with some glue and\\nstarch was applied on the head of a\\nmatch made of suitable wood. When\\nstruck against a rough surface, white\\nphosphorus got ignited due to the heat\\nof friction. This started the\\ncombustion of the match. However ,\\nwhite phosphorus proved to be\\ndangerous both for the workers\\ninvolved in the manufacturing of\\nmatches and for the users.\\nThese days the head of the safety\\nmatch contains only antimony\\ntrisulphide and potassium chlorate.\\nThe rubbing surface has powdered\\nglass and a little red phosphorus\\n(which is much less dangerous).\\nWhen the match is struck against\\nthe rubbing surface, some red\\nphosphorus gets converted into white\\nphosphorus. This immediately reacts\\nwith potassium chlorate in the\\nmatchstick head to produce enough\\nheat to ignite antimony trisulphide\\nand start the combustion.Do these experiences tell you that\\ndifferent substances catch fire at\\ndifferent temperatures?\\nThe lowest temperature at which a\\nsubstance catches fire is called its\\nignition temperature.\\nCan you tell now why a matchstick\\ndoes not catch fire on its own at room\\ntemperature? Why does the matchstick\\nstart burning on rubbing it on the side\\nof the matchbox?\\nFig. 6.5 :  Heating water in a paper cup\\nwater\\npaper\\ncups\\nWhat happens to the empty paper\\ncup? What happens to the paper cup\\nwith water? Does water in this cup\\nbecome hot?\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 68If we continue heating\\nthe cup, we can even boil\\nwater in the paper cup.\\nCan you think of an\\nexplanation for this\\nphenomenon?\\nThe heat supplied to\\nthe paper cup is\\ntransferred to water by\\nconduction. So, in the\\npresence of water , the\\nignition temperature of\\npaper is not reached.\\nHence, it does not burn.\\nThe substances which\\nhave very low ignition\\ntemperature and can\\neasily catch fire with\\na flame are called\\ninflammable substances . Examples of\\ninflammable substances are petrol,\\nalcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG)\\netc. Can you list some more inflammable\\nsubstances?\\n6.2How Do W e Contr ol Fir e?\\nYou must have seen or hear d of fir e\\nbreaking out in homes, shops and\\nfactories. If you have seen such an\\naccident, write a short description in\\nyour note book. Also, share the\\nexperience with your classmates.\\nIt is important that all of us\\nknow the telephone numbers\\nof the fire service.Fig. 6.6: Firemen extinguish the fire by throwing water under pressure\\nFind out the telephone number of the\\nfire service in your area. If a fire\\nbreaks out in your house or in your\\nneighbourhood, the first thing to do\\nis to call the fire service.Does your city/town have a fire\\nbrigade station?\\nWhen a fire brigade arrives, what\\ndoes it do? It pours water on the fire\\n(Fig. 6.6). W ater cools the combustible\\nmaterial so that its temperature is\\nbrought below its ignition\\ntemperature. This prevents the fire\\nfrom spr eading. W ater vapour s also\\nsurround the combustible material,\\nhelping in cutting of f the supply of air .\\nSo, the fire is extinguished.\\nYou have lear\\nnt that ther e are three\\nessential requirements for producing\\nfire. Can you list these requirements?\\nThese are: fuel, air (to supply\\noxygen) and heat (to raise the\\ntemperature of the fuel beyond the\\nignition temperature). Fire can be\\ncontrolled by removing one or more of\\nthese requirements. The job of a fire\\nextinguisher is to cut off the supply of\\nair, or to bring down the temperatur e\\nof the fuel, or both. Notice that the fuel\\n2018-19\\nCOMBUSTION  AND FLAME 69The most common fire\\nextinguisher is water . But\\nwater works only when\\nthings like wood and paper\\nare on fire. If electrical\\nequipment is on fire, water\\nmay conduct electricity\\nand harm those trying to\\ndouse the fir e. W ater is\\nalso not suitable for fires\\ninvolving oil and petrol. Do\\nyou recall that water is\\nheavier than oil? So, it\\nsinks below the oil, and oil\\nkeeps burning on the top.\\nFor fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like\\npetrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher . CO2, being heavier than\\noxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and\\noxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in\\nmost cases it does not harm the electrical equipment.\\nHow do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure\\nas a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When\\nreleased fr om the cylinder , CO2 expands enor mously in volume and cools down.\\nSo, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the\\ntemperatur\\ne of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fir e extinguisher . Another\\nway to get CO2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium\\nbicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these\\nchemicals give off CO2.\\nCAUTION  : Do not handle the gas\\nstove yourself. Ask your parents\\nto help.\\nFig. 6.7 :  Fire extinguisher\\nin most cases cannot be  eliminated.\\nIf, for instance, a building catches fire,\\nthe whole building is the fuel.\\n6.3Types of Combustion\\nBring a burning matchstick or a gas\\nlighter near a gas stove in the kitchen.\\nTurn on the knob of the gas stove. What\\ndo you observe?We find that the gas bur ns rapidly\\nand produces heat and light. Such\\ncombustion is known as \\nrapid\\ncombustion .\\nThere are substances like\\nphosphorus which burn in air at room\\ntemperature.\\nThe type of combustion in which\\na material suddenly bursts into\\nflames, without the application of any\\napparent cause is called spontaneous\\ncombustion.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 70\\nSpontaneous combustion of coal dust\\nhas resulted in many disastrous fires\\nin coal mines. Spontaneous forest\\nfires are sometimes due to the heat\\nof the sun or due to lightning strike.\\nHowever , most for est fir es ar e due to\\nthe carelessness of human beings. It\\nis important to remember that the\\ncampfires must be completely\\nextinguished before leaving a forest\\nafter a picnic, or a visit.\\nWe generally have fir eworks on\\nfestival days. When a cracker is ignited,\\na sudden reaction takes place with the\\nevolution of heat, light and sound. A\\nlarge amount of gas formed in the\\nreaction is liberated. Such a reaction is\\ncalled explosion.  Explosion can also take\\nplace if pressure is applied on the\\ncracker .\\n6.4Flame\\nObserve an LPG flame. Can you tell the\\ncolour of the flame.

They are essential for the\\nwell-being and survival of mankind.\\nToday, a major threat to survival of these\\norganisms is \\ndeforestation .

Mor eover , ther e will be\\nincreased chances of natural calamities\\nsuch as floods and droughts.\\nRecall that plants need carbon\\ndioxide for photosynthesis. Fewer trees\\nwould mean that less carbon dioxide will\\nbe used up resulting in its increasedWhat is the purpose of\\nmaking national parks,\\nwildlife sanctuaries and\\nbiosphere reserves?\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 78amount in the atmosphere. This will lead\\nto global warming as carbon dioxide\\ntraps the heat rays reflected by the earth.\\nThe increase in temperature on the earth\\ndisturbs the water cycle and may reduce\\nrainfall. This could cause droughts .\\nDeforestation is a major cause which\\nleads to the change in soil properties.\\nPhysical properties of the soil get affected\\nby plantation and vegetation. Recall from\\nClass VII how trees prevent soil erosion.\\nFewer trees result in more soil erosion.\\nRemoval of the top layer of the soil exposes\\nthe lower , hard and r ocky layers. This soil\\nhas less humus and is less fertile.\\nGradually the fertile land gets converted\\ninto deserts. It is called desertification .\\nDeforestation also leads to a decrease\\nin the water holding capacity of the soil.\\nThe movement of water from the soil\\nsurface into the gr ound (infiltration rate)\\nis reduced. So, there are floods. The\\nother properties of the soil like nutrient\\ncontent, texture etc., also change\\nbecause of deforestation.\\nWe have studied in Class VII that we\\nget many products from forests. List these\\nproducts. Will we face shortage of these\\nproducts if we continue cutting trees?\\nActivity 7.2\\nAnimal life is also affected by\\ndeforestation. How? List the points\\nand discuss them in your class.\\n7.3 Conservation of Forest\\nand Wildlife\\nHaving become aware of the effects of\\ndeforestation, Paheli and Boojho are\\nworried. They go to Professor Ahmad\\nand ask him how forests and wildlife\\ncan be saved.Biosphere is that part of the earth in\\nwhich living organisms exist or which\\nsupports life. Biological diversity or\\nbiodiversity, refers  to the variety of\\norganisms existing on the earth, their\\ninterrelationships and their\\nrelationship with the environment.\\nProfessor  Ahmad organi s\\nes a visit to\\na biosphere reserve for Paheli, Boojho and\\ntheir classmates. He selects a place\\nnamed Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve. He\\nknows that the plants and animals found\\nhere are similar to those of the upper\\nHimalayan peaks and to those belonging\\nto the lower western ghats. Professor\\nAhmad believes that the biodiversity\\nfound here is unique. He requests\\nMadhavji, a forest employee, to guide the\\nchildren inside the biosphere reserve. He\\nexplains that preserving areas of such\\nbiological importance make them a part\\nof our national heritage .\\nMadhavji explains to the children\\nthat apart from our personal efforts and\\nefforts of the society, government\\nTo protect our flora and fauna and their\\nhabitats, protected areas  called\\nwildlife sanctuaries, national parks\\nand biosphere reserves have been\\nearmarked. Plantation, cultivation,\\ngrazing, felling trees, hunting and\\npoaching are prohibited there.\\nWildlife Sanctuary :  Areas where\\nanimals are protected from any\\ndisturbance to them and their habitat .\\nNational Park : Areas reserved for\\nwild life where they can freely use the\\nhabitats and natural resources.\\nBiosphere Reserve : Large areas of\\nprotected land for conservation of wild\\nlife, plant and animal resources and\\ntraditional life of the tribals living in\\nthe area.\\n2018-19\\nCONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 79agencies also take care of the forests and\\nanimals.

Madhavji explains that\\nbiosphere reserves  are the areas meant\\nfor conservation of biodiversity. As you\\nare aware that biodiversity is the variety\\nof plants, animals and microorganisms\\ngenerally found in an area.  The\\nbiosphere reserves  help to maintain the\\nbiodiversity and culture of that area. A\\nbiosphere reserve may also contain\\nother protected areas in it.

They are\\nvery happy to see tall teak trees and\\nanimals inside the forest. Suddenly,\\nPaheli finds a rabbit and wants to\\ncatch it. She starts running after it.\\nProfessor Ahmad stops her . He\\nexplains that animals are comfortable\\nand happy in their own habitat. W e\\nshould not disturb them.

Wildlife\\nSanctuaries  like reserve forests provide\\nprotection and suitable living conditions\\nto wild animals. He also tells them that\\npeople living in wildlife sanctuaries are\\nallowed to do certain activities such as\\ngrazing by their livestock, collecting\\nmedicinal plants, firewood, etc.instead of  their natural habitat? In\\nyour opinion, will the animals be\\ncomfortable in a zoo or in their\\nnatural habitat?\\n7.8  National Park\\nOn the roadside there was another\\nboard on which was written ‘Satpura\\nNational Park’.\\nChildren are now eager to go there.\\nMadhavji tells them that these reserves\\nare large and diverse enough to protect\\nwhole sets of ecosystems. They preserve\\nflora, fauna, landscape and historic\\nobjects of an area. Satpura National\\nPark is the first Reserve Forest of India.\\nThe finest Indian teak is found in this\\nforest.  There are more than one hundred\\nNational Parks i n India.\\n It is a pity that even protected forests\\nare not safe because people living in the\\nneighbourhood encroach upon them\\nand destroy them.\\nChildren are reminded of their visit\\nto the zoo. They recall that zoos are also\\nplaces where animals receive protection.Some of the threatened wild animals\\nlike black buck, white eyed buck,\\nelephant, golden cat, pink headed\\nduck, gharial, marsh crocodile,\\npython, rhinoceros, etc., are\\nprotected and preserved in our wild\\nlife sanctuaries. Indian sanctuaries\\nhave unique landscapes—broad level\\nforests, mountain forests and bush\\nlands in deltas of big rivers.\\nActivity 7.7\\nVisit a nearby zoo. Observe the\\nconditions provided to the animals.\\nWere they suitable for the animals?\\nCan animals live in artificial settingRock shelters are also found inside\\nthe Satpura National Park.

At times, we kill snakes,\\nfrogs, lizards, bats and owls ruthlessly\\nwithout realising their importance in\\nthe ecosystem. By killing them we are\\nharming ourselves. They might be\\nsmall in size but their role in the\\necosystem cannot be ignored.

He tells\\nthem that Red Data Book  is the\\nsource book which keeps a record of\\nall the endangered animals and\\nplants. Red  Data Book is maintained\\ninternationally by an organisation .\\nIndia also maintains Red Data Book\\nfor plants and animal s found\\nin India.\\n7.10  Migration\\nThe excursion party then enters deeper\\ninto the forest under the guidance of\\nMadhavji.

Paheli\\nobserves some of the birds near the\\nriver. Madhavji tells the childr en that\\nthese are migratory birds. These birds\\nhave flown here from other parts of\\nthe world.\\nMigratory birds fly to far away areas\\nevery year during a particular time\\nbecause of climatic changes. They fly\\nfor laying eggs as the weather in their\\nnatural habitat becomes very cold and\\ninhospitable. Birds who cover long\\ndistances to reach another land are\\nknown as migratory birds as Paheli\\nlearnt in Class VII.\\n7.11  Recycling of Paper\\nProfessor  Ahmad draws attention of\\nthe children to another cause of\\ndeforestation. He tells them that it\\ntakes 17 full grown trees to make one\\ntonne of paper . Ther efore, we should\\nsave paper . Professor  Ahmad also tells\\nthat paper can be recycled five to seven\\ntimes for use. If each student saves at\\nleast one sheet of paper in a day, we\\ncan save many tr ees in a year . We\\nshould save, reuse used paper and\\nrecycle it. By this we not only save\\ntrees but also save  energy and water\\nneeded for manufacturing paper .\\nMoreover , the amount of har mful\\nchemicals used in paper making will\\nalso be reduced.I wonder if there is\\nany record of all\\nendangered species!\\n2018-19\\nCONSER VATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS 857.12  Reforestation\\nProfessor Ahmad suggests that the\\nanswer to deforestation is reforestation.\\nReforestation is restocking of the\\ndestroyed forests by planting new trees.\\nThe planted trees should generally be\\nof the same species which were found\\nin that for est. W e should plant at least\\nas many trees as we cut. Reforestation\\ncan take place naturally also. If the\\ndeforested area is left undisturbed, it re-\\nestablishes itself. In natural reforestation\\nthere is no r ole of human beings. W e\\nhave already caused tremendous\\ndamage to our forests. If we have toretain our green wealth for future\\ngenerations, plantation of more trees is\\nthe only option.\\nProfessor Ahmad told them that in\\nIndia we have the Forest (Conservation)\\nAct. This act is aimed at preservation\\nand conservation of natural forests and\\nmeeting the basic needs of the people\\nliving in or near the forests.\\nAfter some rest Madhavji asks the\\nchildren to start heading back because\\nit is not advisable to stay in the\\njungle after sunset.

In this\\nchapter , you shall lear n about the basic\\nstructural unit of an organ, which is the\\ncell.\\n Cells may be compared to bricks.\\nBricks are assembled to make a building.\\nSimilarly, cells are assembled to make\\nthe body of every organism.\\n8.1Discovery of the Cell\\nRobert Hooke in 1665 observed slices of\\ncork under a simple magnifying device.\\nCork is a part of the bark of a\\ntree.  He took thin slices of cork and\\nobserved them under a microscope. He\\nnoticed partitioned boxes or\\ncompartments in the cork slice (Fig. 8.1).These boxes appeared like a honey-\\ncomb. He also noticed that one box was\\nseparated from the other by a wall or\\npartition. Hooke coined the term ‘cell’\\nfor each box. What Hooke observed as\\nboxes or cells in the cork were actually\\ndead cells.\\nCells of living organisms could be\\nobserved only after the discovery of\\nimproved micr oscopes. V ery little was\\nknown about the cell for the next 150\\nyears after Robert Hooke’s observations.\\nToday, we know a lot about cell\\nstructure and its functions because of\\nimproved microscopes having high\\nmagnification.\\n8.2 The Cell\\nBoth, bricks in a building and cells in\\nthe living organisms, are basic\\nstructural units [Fig. 8.2(a), (b)]. The\\nbuildings, though built of similar bricks,\\nhave different designs, shapes and sizes.\\nSimilarly, in the living world, organisms\\ndiffer from one another but all are made\\nup of cells. Cells in the living organisms\\nare complex living structures unlike\\nnon-living bricks.\\nFig. 8.1: Cork cells as observed by\\nRobert Hooke\\nA hen’s egg can be seen\\neasily. Is it a cell or a\\ngroup of cells?\\n2018-19\\nThe egg of a hen represents a single\\ncell and is big enough to be seen by the\\nunaided eye.\\n8.3Organisms show V ariety\\nin Cell Number , Shape and\\nSize\\nHow do scientists observe and study the\\nliving cells? They use microscopes which\\nmagnify objects. Stains (dyes) are used\\nto colour parts of the cell to study the\\ndetailed structure.\\nThere are millions of living\\norganisms. They are of different shapes\\nand sizes. Their organs also vary in\\nshape, size and number of cells. Let us\\nstudy about some of them.\\nNumber of Cells\\nCan you guess the number of cells in a\\ntall tree or in a huge animal like the\\nelephant? The number runs into\\nbillions and trillions. Human body has\\ntrillions of cells which vary in shapes\\nand sizes. Different groups of cells\\nperfor m a variety of functions.Organisms made of more than one\\ncell are called multicellular  (multi  :\\nmany; cellular : cell) organisms. The\\nnumber of cells being less in smaller\\norganisms does not, in any way, affect\\nthe functioning of the or ganisms. Y ou\\nwill be surprised to know that an\\norganism with billions of cells begins\\nlife as a single cell  which is the fertilised\\negg. The fertilised egg cell multiplies and\\nthe number of cells increase as\\ndevelopment proceeds.\\nLook at Fig 8.3 (a) and (b).

Similar functions in\\nmulticellular organisms are carried out\\nby groups of specialised cells forming\\ndif\\nferent tissues. Tissues, in tur n, for m\\norgans.\\nActivity 8.1\\nThe teacher may show a permanent\\nslide of amoeba  and paramecium\\nunder a microscope. Alternatively,\\nthe teacher can collect pond water\\nand show these organisms by\\npreparing the slides.\\nShape of Cells\\nRefer to Fig .\\n 8.3 (a). How do you define\\nthe shape of amoeba  in the figur e? You\\nmay say that the shape appears\\nirregular . Infact, amoeba  has no\\ndefinite shape, unlike other organisms.\\nIt keeps on changing its shape.\\nObserve the projections of varying\\nlengths protruding out of its\\nbody. These are called pseudopodia\\n(pseudo  : false; podia : feet),  as you\\nlearnt in Class VII. These projections\\nappear and disappear as amoeba\\nmoves or feeds.A white blood cell (WBC) in human\\nblood is another example of a single cell\\nwhich can change its shape. But while\\nWBC is a cell, amoeba is a full fledged\\norganism capable of independent\\nexistence.\\nWhat shape would you expect in\\norganisms with millions of cells? Fig.\\n8.4 (a, b, c) shows different cells such\\nas blood, muscle and nerve of human\\nbeings. The different shapes are related\\nto their specific functions.\\nGenerally, cells are round, spherical\\nor elongated [Fig. 8.4(a)]. Some cells are\\nlong and pointed at both ends. They\\nexhibit a spindle shape [Fig. 8.4(b)].\\nCells sometimes are quite long. Some\\nare branched like the nerve cell or a\\nneuron [Fig. 8.4(c)]. The nerve cell\\nreceives and transfers messages, therebyThe change in shape is due to\\nformation of pseudopodia which\\nfacilitates movement and help\\nin capturing food.\\nFig. 8.4 : (a) Spherical red blood cells\\nof humans, (b) Spindle\\nshaped muscle cells,\\n(c) Long branched nerve cell(a)\\n(b)(c)\\nWhat advantage does\\namoeba  derive by\\nchanging shape?\\n2018-19\\nCELL — S TRUCTURE  AND FUNCTIONS 93the elephant be much bigger than those\\nin a rat.

You have\\nstudied in Class VII about the digestive\\norgans which together constitute the\\ndigestive system. Each organ in the\\nsystem per forms dif ferent functions\\nsuch as  digestion, assimilation and\\nabsorption. Similarly, different organs\\nof a plant per form specific/specialised\\nfunctions. For example, roots help in the\\nabsorption of water and minerals.\\nLeaves, as you have learnt in Class VII,\\nare responsible for synthesis of food.\\nEach organ is further made up of\\nsmaller parts called tissues . A tissue is\\na group of similar cells per forming  a\\nspecific function.\\nPaheli realised that an organ is made\\nup of tissues which in turn, are made\\nup of cells. The cell in a living organism\\nis the basic structural unit.\\n8.5Parts of the Cell\\nCell Membrane\\nThe basic components of a cell are cell\\nmembrane, cytoplasm and nucleus\\n(Fig. 8.7)\\n. The cytoplasm and nucleus\\nare enclosed within the cell membrane,\\nalso called the plasma membrane. The\\nmembrane separates cells from one\\nanother and also the cell from the\\nsurrounding medium. The plasma\\nmembrane is porous and allows thehelping to control and coordinate the\\nworking of different parts of the body.\\nCan you guess, which part of the cell\\ngives it shape? Components of the cell\\nare enclosed in a membrane. This\\nmembrane provides shape to the cells\\nof plants and animals. Cell wall is an\\nadditional covering over the cell\\nmembrane in plant cells.  It gives shape\\nand rigidity to these cells (Fig. 8.7).\\nBacterial cell also has a cell wall.\\nSize of Cells\\nThe size of cells in living organisms may\\nbe as small as a millionth of a metre\\n(micrometre or micron) or may be as large\\nas a few centimetr es. However , most of the\\ncells are microscopic in size and are not\\nvisible to the unaided eye. They need to\\nbe enlarged or magnified by a microscope.\\nThe smallest cell is 0.1 to 0.5 micrometre\\nin bacteria.  The largest cell measuring\\n170 mm ×130 mm, is the egg of an ostrich.\\nActivity 8.2\\nBoil a hen’s egg. Remove the shell.\\nWhat do you observe?

Y ou\\ncan also break the onion bulb and\\nseparate out thin  layers.

In\\naddition to the cell membrane, there is\\nan outer thick layer in cells of plants\\ncalled cell wall . This additional layer\\nsurrounding the cell membrane is\\nrequired by plants for protection. Plant\\ncells need protection against variations\\nin temperature, high wind speed,\\natmospheric moisture etc. They\\nare exposed to these variations\\nbecause they cannot move. Cells can\\nbe observed in the leaf peel of\\nTradescantia,  Elodea or Rhoeo . You\\ncan prepare a slide as in the case\\nof onion.\\nPaheli asks Boojho if he can also\\nobserve animal cells.\\nActivity 8.4\\nTake a clean tooth pick, or a\\nmatchstick with the tip broken.\\nScrape inside of your cheek without\\nhurting it.

Y ou may\\nnotice several cells in the scraped\\nmaterial (Fig. 8.6). Y ou can identify\\nthe cell membrane, the cytoplasm\\nand nucleus. A cell wall is absent\\nin animal cells.The boundary of the onion cell is the\\ncell membrane  covered by another thick\\ncovering called the cell wall. The central\\ndense round body in the centre is called\\nthe nucleus . The jelly-like substance\\nFig. 8.5 : Cells observed in an onion peelnucleus\\ncytoplasm\\n2018-19\\nCELL — S TRUCTURE  AND FUNCTIONS 95Cytoplasm\\nIt is the jelly-like substance present\\nbetween the cell membrane and the\\nnucleus. V arious other components, or\\norganelles , of cells are present in the\\ncytoplasm. These are mitochondria, golgi\\nbodies, ribosomes, etc. Y ou will lear n\\nabout them in later classes.\\nNucleus\\nIt is an important component of the\\nliving cell. It is generally spherical and\\nlocated in the centre of the cell. It can\\nbe stained and seen easily with the help\\nof a microscope. Nucleus is separated\\nfrom the cytoplasm by a membrane\\ncalled the nuclear membrane . This\\nmembrane is also porous and allows the\\nmovement of materials between the\\ncytoplasm and the inside of the nucleus.\\nWith a microscope of higher\\nmagnification, we can see a smaller\\nspherical body in the nucleus. It is called\\nthe nucleolus . In addition, nucleus\\ncontains thread-like structures called\\nchromosomes . These carry genes  and\\nhelp in inheritance or transfer of\\ncharacters from the parents to the\\noffspring . The chromosomes can be seen\\nonly when the cell divides.\\nNucleus, in addition to its role in\\ninheritance, acts as control centre of the\\nactivities of the cell. The entire content\\nof a living cell is known as protoplasm.\\nIt includes the cytoplasm and the\\nnucleus. Protoplasm is called the living\\nsubstance of the cell.Gene\\nGene is a unit of inheritance in living\\norganisms. It controls the transfer of\\na hereditary characteristic from\\nparents to offspring. This means that\\nyour parents pass some of their\\ncharacteristics on to you. If your father\\nhas brown eyes, you may also have\\nbrown eyes. If your mother has curly\\nhair, you might also end up having\\ncurly hair . However , the dif ferent\\ncombination of genes from parents\\nresult in different characteristics.\\nPaheli wants to know if the\\nstructure of the nucleus is\\nthe same in cells of plants,\\nanimals and bacteria.\\nThe nucleus of the bacterial cell is\\nnot well-organised like the cells of\\nmulticellular organisms. There is no\\nnuclear membrane. The cells having\\nnuclear material without nuclear\\nmembrane are termed prokaryotic\\ncells.  The organisms with these kinds\\nof cells are called prokaryotes (pro :\\nprimitive; karyon  : nucleus). Examples\\nare bacteria and blue green algae. The\\ncells, like  onion cells and cheek cells\\nhaving well-organised nucleus with\\na nuclear membrane are designated\\nas eukaryotic cells .

It is called vacuole . It could\\nbe single and big as in an onion cell.\\nCheek cells have smaller vacuoles. Large\\nvacuoles are common in plant cells.\\nVacuoles in animal cells ar e much\\nsmaller .\\nYou might have noticed several small\\ncoloured bodies in the cytoplasm of the\\ncells of Tradescantia leaf. They ar e\\nscattered in the cytoplasm of the leaf\\ncells. These are called plastids . They are\\nof different colours. Some of them\\ncontain green pigment called\\nchlorophyll. Green coloured plastids arecalled chloroplasts . They provide green\\ncolour to the leaves. Y ou may r ecall that\\nchlorophyll in the chloroplasts of leaves,\\nis essential for photosynthesis.\\n8.6Comparison of Plant and\\nAnimal Cells\\nIf you recall Activities 8.3 and 8.4, you\\nshould be able to compare plant and\\nanimal cells.

These\\nprocesses are essential for the survival\\nof every individual. Y ou have also lear nt\\nabout the process of reproduction in\\nplants. Reproduction is essential for the\\ncontinuation of a species. Imagine what\\nwould have happened if organisms had\\nnot r eproduced. Y ou will r ealise that\\nreproduction is very important as it\\nensures the continuation of similar\\nkinds of individuals, generation after\\ngeneration.\\nYou have alr eady lear nt in your\\nprevious class about reproduction in\\nplants. In this chapter , we shall lear n\\nhow reproduction takes place in\\nanimals.\\n9.1 Modes of Reproduction\\nHave you seen the young ones\\nof dif ferent animals? T ry to name some\\nof the young ones by completing\\nTable 9.1 shown in examples at S.

Do you think that\\nthese young ones looked the same\\nbefore they were born as they do now?\\nLet us find out.Just as in plants, there are two modes\\nby which animals reproduce. These are:\\n(i)Sexual reproduction, and\\n(ii)Asexual reproduction.\\n9.2 Sexual Reproduction\\nTry to r ecall r eproduction in plants\\nwhich you studied in Class VII. Y ou will\\nremember that plants that reproduce\\nsexually have male and female\\nreproductive parts. Can you name these\\nparts? In animals also, males and\\nfemales have different reproductive parts\\nor organs. Like plants, the reproductive\\nparts in animals also produce gametes\\nthat fuse to form a zygote. It is the zygote\\nwhich develops into a new individual.\\nThis type of reproduction beginning\\nfrom the fusion of male and female\\ngametes is called sexual reproduction .\\nLet us find out the reproductive partsTable 9.1\\nS.

The testes\\nproduce the male gametes called\\nsperms . Millions of sperms are produced\\nby the testes. Look at Fig. 9.2 which\\nshows the picture of a sperm. Though\\nsperms are very small in size, each has\\na head, a middle piece and a tail. Does\\nit appear to be a single cell? Indeed, eachsperm is a single cell with all the usual\\ncell components.\\nFig. 9.1: Male reproductive\\norgans in humansWhat purpose does the\\ntail in a sperm serve?\\nFig. 9.3 : Female reproductive organs in\\nhumansFemale Reproductive Organs\\nThe female reproductive organs are a pair\\nof ovaries, oviducts (fallopian tubes) and\\nthe uterus (Fig. 9.3).

Ostrich egg is\\nthe largest!\\nFertilisation\\nThe first step in the process of\\nreproduction is the fusion of a sperm\\nand an ovum. When sperms come in\\ncontact with an egg, one of the sperms\\nmay fuse with the egg. Such fusion of\\nthe egg and the sperm is called\\nfertilisation (Fig. 9.5). During\\nfertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and\\nthe egg fuse to form a single nucleus.\\nThis results in the formation of a\\nfertilised egg or zygote  (Fig. 9.6). Did\\nFig. 9.5 :  Fertilisation\\nFig. 9.4 :  Human OvumNucleusSperms\\nOvum\\nFusing\\nnuclei\\nThe process of fertilisation is the\\nmeeting of an egg cell from the mother\\nand a sper m cell fr om the father . So,\\nthe new individual inherits some\\ncharacteristics  from the mother and\\nsome fr om the father . Look at your\\nbrother or sister . See if you can r ecognise\\nsome characters in them similar to those\\nof your mother or your father .\\nFertilisation which takes place inside\\nthe female body is called internal\\nfertilisation . Internal fertilisation\\noccurs in many animals including\\nhumans, cows, dogs and hens.Fig. 9.6 :  Zygotefemale gametes called ova (eggs)\\n(Fig. 9.4). In human beings, a single\\nmatured egg is released into the oviduct\\nby one of the ovaries every month.\\nUterus is the part where development of\\nthe baby takes place. Like the sperm,\\nan egg is also a single cell.\\nyou know that the zygote is the\\nbeginning of a new individual?\\n2018-19\\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 103Why do fish and\\nfrogs lay eggs in\\nhundreds whereas a\\nhen lays only one\\negg at a time?\\nHave you heard of\\ntest tube babies?\\nBoojho and Paheli’s teacher once told\\nthem in the class that in some women\\noviducts are blocked. These women\\nare unable to bear babies because\\nsperms cannot reach the egg for\\nfertilisation. In such cases, doctors\\ncollect freshly released egg and\\nsperms and keep them together for a\\nfew hours for IVF or in vitro\\nfertilisation  (fertilisation outside the\\nbody). In case fertilisation occurs,\\nthe zygote is allowed to develop for\\nabout a week and then it is placed in\\nthe mother’s uterus. Complete\\ndevelopment takes place in the uterus\\nand the baby is born like any other\\nbaby. Babies born through this\\ntechnique are called test-tube\\nbabies . This term is actually\\nmisleading because babies cannot\\ngrow in test tubes.Fig. 9.7 :  Eggs of frogfemale lays hundreds of eggs. Unlike\\nhen’s egg, frog’s egg is not covered by a\\nshell and it is comparatively very\\ndelicate. A layer of jelly holds the eggs\\ntogether and provides protection to the\\neggs (Fig. 9.7).\\nYou will be surprised to know that\\nin many animals fertili sation takes\\nplace outside the body of the female.\\nIn these animals, fertili sation takes\\nplace in water . Let us find out how\\nthis happens.\\nActivity 9.1\\nVisit some ponds or slow-flowing\\nstreams during spring or rainy\\nseason. Look out for clusters of\\nfrog’s eggs floating in water .\\nWrite down the colour and size of\\nthe eggs.\\nDuring spring or rainy season, frogs\\nand toads move to ponds and slow-\\nflowing streams. When the male and\\nfemale come together in water , theAs the eggs are laid, the male\\ndeposits sperms over them. Each\\nsperm swims randomly in water with\\nthe help of its long tail. The sperms\\ncome in contact with the eggs. This\\nresults in fertili sation. This type of\\nfertili s\\nation in which the fusion of a\\nmale and a female gamete takes place\\noutside the body of the female is called\\nexternal fertili sation . It is very\\ncommon in aquatic animals such as\\nfish, star fish, etc.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 104\\nDevelopment of Embryo\\nFertilisation results in the formation of\\nzygote which begins to develop into an\\nembryo [Fig. 9.8(a)]. The zygote divides\\nrepeatedly to give rise to a ball of cells\\n[Fig. 9.8(b)]. The cells then begin to form\\ngroups that develop into different tissues\\nand organs of the body. This developing\\nstructure is termed an embryo . The\\nembryo gets embedded in the wall of the\\nuterus for further development\\n[Fig. 9.8(c)].\\nThe embryo continues to develop in\\nthe uterus. It gradually develops body\\nFig. 9.8 : (a) Zygote formation and development of an embryo from the zygote; (b) Ball of cells\\n(enlarged); (c) Embedding of the embryo in the uterus (enlarged)How could a single cell\\nbecome such a big\\nindividual?\\n(b)\\n(a)\\n(c)Uterus\\nEmbedding\\nembryoOvary\\nOvulationZygote\\nUterus\\nwall\\nDeveloping\\nembryo\\nThough these animals lay\\nhundreds of eggs and release\\nmillions of sperms, all the eggs\\ndo not get fertilised and develop\\ninto new individuals.\\nThis is because the eggs and\\nsperms get exposed to  water\\nmovement, wind and rainfall.\\nAlso, there are other animals in\\nthe pond which may feed\\non eggs. Thus, production\\nof large number of eggs and\\nsperms is necessary to\\nensure fertilisation\\nof at least\\na few of them.\\n2018-19\\nREPRODUCTION  IN ANIMALS 105parts such as hands, legs, head, eyes,\\nears etc. The stage of the embryo in\\nwhich all the body parts can be\\nidentified is called a foetus (Fig. 9.9).\\nWhen the development of the foetus is\\ncomplete,  the mother gives birth to\\nthe baby.place inside the egg shell during this\\nperiod? After the chick is completely\\ndeveloped it bursts open the egg shell.\\nIn animals which undergo external\\nfertilisation, development of the embryo\\ntakes place outside the female body. The\\nembryos continue to grow within their\\negg coverings. After the embryos develop,\\nthe eggs hatch. Y\\nou must have seen\\nnumerous tadpoles swimming in ponds\\nand streams.\\nViviparous and Oviparous Animals\\nWe have learnt that some animals give\\nbirth to young ones while some animals\\nlay eggs which later develop into young\\nones. The animals which give birth to\\nyoung ones are called viviparous\\nanimals. Those animals which lay eggs\\nare called oviparous animals. The\\nfollowing activity will help you\\nunderstand better and differentiate\\nbetween viviparous and oviparous\\nanimals.\\nActivity 9.2\\nTry to observe eggs of the following\\norganisms – fr og, lizar\\nd, butter fly\\nor moth, hen and crow or any other\\nbird. W ere you able to observe eggs\\nof all of them? Make drawings of  the\\neggs that you have observed.\\nThe eggs of a few animals are easy\\nto observe  because their mothers lay\\nthem outside their bodies. These are\\nexamples of oviparous animals. But you\\nwould not be able to collect the eggs of\\na dog, cow or cat. This is because they\\ndo not lay eggs. The mother gives birth\\nto the young ones. These are examples\\nof viviparous animals.Fig. 9.9 :  Foetus in the uterusUterus\\nInternal fertilisation takes place in\\nhens also. But, do hens give birth to\\nbabies like human beings and cows? Y ou\\nknow that they do not. Then, how are\\nchicks born? Let us find out.\\nSoon after fertilisation, the zygote\\ndivides repeatedly and travels down the\\noviduct. As it travels down, many\\nprotective layers are formed around it.\\nThe hard shell that you see in a hen’s\\negg is one such pr otective layer .\\nAfter the hard shell is formed around\\nthe developing embryo, the hen finally\\nlays the egg.

In some\\nanimals, the young ones may look very\\ndifferent from the adults. Recall the life\\ncycle of the silkworm (egg → larva or\\ncaterpillar → pupa → adult) you studied\\nin Class VII. Frog is another such\\nexample (Fig. 9.10).\\nObserve the different stages of frog\\nstarting from the egg to the adult stage.\\nWe find that ther e are thr ee distinct\\nstages, that is, egg → tadpole (larva) →\\nadult. Don’t the tadpoles look so\\ndifferent from the adults? Can you\\nimagine that these tadpoles would some\\nday become frogs? Similarly, the\\ncaterpillar or the pupa of silkworm looks\\nvery different from the adult  moth . Thefeatures that are present in the adult are\\nnot found in these young ones. Then what\\nhappens to the tadpoles or caterpillars\\nthereafter?\\nYou must have seen a beautiful moth\\nemerging out of the cocoon. In the case of\\ntadpoles, they transform into adults\\ncapable of jumping and swimming. The\\ntransformation of the larva into an adult\\nthrough drastic changes is called\\nmetamorphosis . What about the changes\\nthat we observe in our body as we grow?\\nDo you think we too undergo\\nmetamorphosis? In human beings, body\\nparts similar to those present in the adults\\nare present from the time of birth.\\n9.3 Asexual Reproduction\\nSo far , we have lear nt about r epr\\noduction\\nin some familiar animals.

These bulges are the\\ndeveloping new individuals and they are\\ncalled buds. Recall the presence of buds\\nin yeast. In hydra too the new individuals\\ndevelop as outgrowths from a single\\nparent. This type of reproduction in\\nwhich only a single parent is involved is\\ncalled asexual reproduction . Since new\\nindividuals develop from the buds in\\nhydra, this type of asexual reproduction\\nis called budding .\\nAnother method of asexual\\nreproduction is observed in the\\nmicroscopic organism, amoeba. Let us\\nsee how this happens.\\nYou have alr eady lear nt about the\\nstructur e of amoeba. Y ou will r ecall that\\namoeba is a single-celled organism\\n[Fig. 9.12(a)]. It begins the process of\\nreproduction by the division of its\\nnucleus into two nuclei [Fig. 9.12(b)].\\nThis is followed by division of its body\\ninto two, each part receiving a nucleus\\n[Fig. 9.12(c)]. Finally, two amoebae are\\nproduced from one parent amoeba\\n[Fig. 9.12(d)]. This type of asexual\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 108Story of Dolly, the Clone\\nCloning is the production of an exact copy of a cell, any other living part, or a\\ncomplete organism. Cloning of an animal was successfully performed for the first\\ntime by Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh,\\nScotland. They successfully cloned a sheep named Dolly [Fig. 9.13 (c)]. Dolly was\\nborn on 5th July 1996 and was the first mammal to be cloned.\\n(a) Finn Dorsett sheep (b) Scottish blackface ewe (c) Dolly\\nFig. 9.13\\nDuring the process of cloning Dolly, a cell was collected from the mammary gland\\nof a female Finn Dorsett sheep [Fig. 9.13 (a)]. Simultaneously, an egg was obtained\\nfrom a Scottish blackface ewe [Fig. 9.13 (b)]. The nucleus was removed from the\\negg. Then, the nucleus of the mammary gland cell from the Finn Dorsett sheep\\nwas inserted into the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe whose nucleus had been\\nremoved. The egg thus produced was implanted into the Scottish blackface ewe.\\nDevelopment of this egg followed normally and finally Dolly was born. Though\\nDolly was given birth by the Scottish blackface ewe, it was found to be absolutely\\nidentical to the Finn Dorsett sheep from which the nucleus was taken. Since the\\nnucleus from the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe was removed, Dolly did not\\nshow any character of the Scottish blackface ewe.

It is\\nonly after ‘growing up’ to a certain\\nage that human beings and many other\\nanimals can reproduce. Why can\\nhumans reproduce only after a certain\\nage?\\nIn this chapter , you will lear n about\\nchanges that take place in the human\\nbody after which a person becomes\\ncapable of reproduction.\\nIn Chapter 9 ,\\n you have learnt about\\nhuman reproductive organs. Here, we\\nshall discuss the role that hormones play\\nin bringing about changes that make a\\nchild grow into an adult.\\n10.1 Adolescence and Puberty\\nBoojho was celebrating his 12th\\nbirthday. After his friends left, Boojho\\nand Paheli began chatting with their\\nparents. Paheli studies in an all-girls\\nschool. She started laughing. She\\nremarked that many of Boojho’s  school\\nfriends, whom she met after a year , had\\nsuddenly shot up in height. Some of\\nthem were looking very funny with a\\nhairy line above their lips. Her mother\\nexplained that the boys had grown up.\\nGrowth begins from the day one is\\nborn. But upon crossing the age of 10\\nor 11, there is a sudden spurt in growth\\nwhich becomes noticeable. The changes\\ntaking place in the body are part of\\ngrowing up. They indicate that you areI wonder how long this\\nperiod marked by changes\\nin the body will last!\\nno longer  a child but are on the way to\\nbecoming an adult.\\nIt is a strange period of life\\nwhen you are neither a child nor\\nan adult. I wonder whether this\\nperiod between childhood and\\nadulthood had a special name!\\nGrowing up is a natural process. The\\nperiod of life, when the body undergoes\\nchanges, leading to reproductive\\nmaturity, is called adolescence.\\nAdolescence begins around the age of\\n11 and lasts upto 18 or 19 years of age.\\nSince this period covers the ‘teens’ (13\\nto 18 or 19 years of age), adolescents\\nare also called ‘teenagers’. In girls,\\nadolescence may begin a year or two\\nearlier than in boys. Also, the period of\\nadolescence  varies  from person to person.\\nThe human body undergoes several\\nchanges during adolescence. These\\nchanges mark the onset of puberty . The\\nmost important change which marks\\npuberty is that boys and girls become\\ncapable of reproduction. Puberty ends\\nwhen an adolescent reaches reproductive\\nmaturity.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 114\\n% of full height\\nBoys Girls\\n8 72% 77%\\n9 75% 81%\\n10 78% 84%\\n11 81% 88%\\n12 84% 91%\\n13 88% 95%\\n14 92% 98%\\n15 95% 99%\\n16 98% 99.5%\\n17 99% 100%\\n18 100% 100%Age in\\nYearsPaheli and Boojho\\nrealised that sudden\\nincrease in height and\\nhairy line above the lips\\nin boys were signs of\\nadolescence. They\\nwanted to know more\\nabout other changes at\\npuberty.\\n10.2 Changes at Puberty\\nIncrease in Height\\nThe most conspicuous change during\\npuberty is the sudden increase in\\nheight. At this time the long bones, that\\nis, the bones of the arms and the legs\\nelongate and make a person tall.\\nActivity 10.1\\nThe following chart gives the\\naverage rate of growth in height of\\nboys and girls with age. The figures\\nin columns 2 and 3, give the\\npercentage of the height a person\\nhas reached at the age given in\\ncolumn 1. For example, by the age\\n11, a boy has reached 81% of his\\nprobable full height, while a girl\\nhas reached 88% of her full\\nheight. These figures are only\\nrepresentative and there may be\\nindividual variations.\\nUse the Table for your friends\\nand work out how tall they are likely\\nto be.

Sometimes the arms and legs\\nor hands and feet of adolescents look\\noversized and out of proportion with the\\nbody. But soon the other parts catch\\nup and result in a proportionate body.\\nYou must have noticed that height\\nof an individual is more or less similar\\nto that of some family member . This is\\nbecause height depends on the genes\\ninherited fr om par ents. It is, however ,\\nvery important to eat the right kind of\\nfood during these growing years. This\\nhelps the bones, muscles and other\\nparts of the body get adequate\\nnourishment for gr owth. Y ou will find\\nnutritional needs of adolescents\\ndiscussed later in the lesson.\\nChange in Body Shape\\nHave you noticed that boys in your class\\nhave broader shoulders and wider chests\\nthan boys in  junior classes? This is\\nbecause they have entered the age of\\npuberty when shoulders generally\\nbroaden as a result of growth. In girls,\\nthe region below the waist becomes\\nwider .\\nIn boys, the muscles of the body grow\\nmore prominently than in the girls.\\nThus, changes occurring in adolescent\\nboys and girls are different.\\nVoice Change\\nDid you notice that sometimes the voice\\nof some of the boys in your class cracks?\\nAt puberty, the voice box  or the larynx\\nbegins to grow. Boys develop larger voice\\nboxes. The growing voice box in boys can\\nbe seen as a protruding part of the throatActivity 10.2\\nUse the data given in Activity 10.1\\nto draw a graph.

At puberty, male\\nsex organs like the testes and penis\\ndevelop completely. The testes also\\nbegin to produce sperms. In girls, the\\novaries enlarge and eggs begin to\\nmature. Also ovaries start releasing\\nmature eggs .\\nReaching Mental, Intellectual and\\nEmotional Maturity\\nAdolescence is also a period of change\\nin a person’s way of thinking.\\nAdolescents are more independent than\\nbefore and are also self conscious.\\nIntellectual development takes place and\\nthey tend to spend considerable time\\nthinking. In fact, it is often the time in\\none’s life when the brain has the\\ngreatest capacity for learning.\\nSometimes, however , an adolescent may\\nfeel insecure while trying to adjust to\\nthe changes in the body and mind. But\\nas adolescent learners, you should know\\nthat there is no reason to feel insecure.\\nThese changes are a natural part of\\ngrowing up.\\n10.3 Secondary Sexual\\nCharacters\\nYou have lear nt in Chapter 9, that\\ntestes and ovaries are the reproductive\\norgans. They produce the gametes,\\nthat is, sperms and ova. In girls,\\nbreasts begin to develop at pubertyMany of my classmates\\nhave a hoarse voice. Now I\\nknow why?\\nFig. 10.2 : Adam’s apple in a grown up boycalled Adam’s apple  (Fig. 10.2). In girls,\\nthe larynx is hardly visible from the\\noutside because of its small size.\\nGenerally, girls have a high pitched voice,\\nwhereas boys have a deep voice. In\\nadolescent boys, sometimes, the muscles\\nof the growing voice box go out of control\\nand the voice becomes hoarse. This state\\nmay remain for a few days or weeks after\\nwhich the voice becomes normal.\\nA few glands such as sweat glands,\\noil glands and salivary glands release\\ntheir secretions through ducts.\\nEndocrine glands release hormones\\ndirectly into the bloodstream. So, they\\nare also termed ductless glands.Increased Activity of Sweat and\\nSebaceous Glands\\nDuring puberty the secretion of sweat\\nglands and sebaceous glands (oil glands)\\nincreases.

As these\\nfeatures help to distinguish the male\\nfrom the female they are called\\nsecondary sexual characters . Boys\\nalso develop hair on their chest. In\\nboth, boys and girls, hair grows under\\nthe arms and in the region above the\\nthighs or the pubic region.\\nPaheli and Boojho have now\\nunderstood that puberty marks the\\nbeginning of the reproductive period\\nwhen one becomes capable of\\nreproduction. But they want to know\\nif reproductive life, once begun,\\ncontinues, or it ends some time.The testes and ovaries secrete sex\\nhormones. Y ou have just lear nt that\\nthese hormones are responsible for the\\nmale and female secondary sexual\\ncharacters. Further , the sex hor mones\\nare under the control of hormones from\\nthe pituitary gland (Fig. 10.3). The\\npituitary secretes many hormones, one\\nof which makes ova mature in the\\novaries and sperms form in the testes.\\nBoth Boojho and Paheli wish to know\\nwhat initiates changes at puberty.\\nFig. 10.3 : The onset of puberty is controlled by\\nhormonesThe changes which occur at\\nadolescence are controlled by\\nhormones.  Hormones are chemical\\nsubstances. These are secretions from\\nendocrine glands , or endocrine system.\\nThe male hormone or testosterone\\nbegins to be released by the testes at\\nthe onset of puberty. This causes\\nchanges in boys about which you have\\njust learnt, for example, the growth of\\nfacial hair . Once puberty is r eached in\\ngirls, ovaries begin to produce the \\nfemale\\nhormone or estrogen which makes the\\nbreasts develop. Milk secreting glands\\nor mammary glands develop inside the\\nbreasts. The production of these\\nhormones is under the control of\\nanother hormone secreted from an\\nendocrine gland called pituitary gland .\\n10.4 Role of Hormones in\\nInitiating Reproductive\\nFunction\\nEndocrine glands release hormones\\ninto the bloodstream to reach a\\nparticular body part called target site .\\nThe target site responds to the\\nhormone. There are many endocrine\\nglands  or ductless glands in the body.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 11810.5 Reproductive Phase of\\nLife in Humans\\nAdolescents become capable of\\nreproduction when their testes and\\novaries begin to produce gametes. The\\ncapacity for maturation  and production\\nof gametes lasts for a much longer time\\nin males than in females.\\nIn females, the reproductive phase of\\nlife begins at puberty (10 to 12 years of\\nage) and generally lasts till the age of\\napproximately 45 to 50 years. The ova\\nbegin to mature with the onset of\\npuberty. One ovum matures and is\\nreleased by one of the ovaries once in\\nabout 28 to 30 days. During this\\nperiod, the wall of the uterus becomes\\nthick so as to receive the egg, in case\\nit is fertilised and begins to develop.\\nThis results in pregnancy. If\\nfertilisation does not occur , the\\nreleased egg, and the thickened lining\\nof the uterus along with its blood\\nvessels are shed off. This causes\\nbleeding in women which is called\\nmenstruation . Menstruation occurs\\nonce in about 28 to 30 days. The first\\nmenstrual flow begins at puberty  and\\nis termed menarche . At 45 to 50 years\\nof age, the menstrual cycle stops.\\nStoppage of menstruation is termed\\nmenopause.  Initially, menstrual cycle\\nmay be irr egular . It take some time to\\nbecome r egular .Menstrual cycle is controlled by\\nhormones. The cycle includes the\\nmaturation of the egg, its release,\\nthickening of uterine wall and its\\nbreakdown if pregnancy does not\\noccur . In case the egg is fertilised it\\nbegins to divide and then gets\\nembedded in the uterus for further\\ndevelopment as you have learnt in\\nChapter 9 (Fig. 9.8).\\n10.6 How is the Sex of the\\nBaby Determined?\\nI heard my mother and my\\naunt talking about my cousin\\nwho is going to have a baby.\\nThey were discussing whether\\nshe would give birth to a boy\\nor a girl. I wonder what makes\\nthe fertilised egg develop\\neither into a boy or a girl!\\nPaheli says that the\\nreproductive life of a\\nwoman lasts from\\nmenarche to menopause.\\nIs she right?Boy or Girl?\\nInside the fertilised egg or zygote is the\\ninstruction for determining the sex of\\nthe baby. This instruction is present in\\nthe thread-like structures, called\\nchromosomes  in the fertilised egg.\\nRecall from Chapter 8, that\\nchromosomes are present inside the\\nnucleus of every cell. All human beings\\nhave 23 pairs of chromosomes in the\\nnuclei of their cells. Two chromosomes\\nout of these are the sex chromosomes,\\nnamed X and Y . A female has two X\\nchromosomes, while a male has one X\\nand one Y chromosome. The gametes\\n(egg and sperm) have only one set of\\nchromosomes. The unfertilised egg\\nalways has one X chromosome. But\\n2018-19\\nREACHING  THE AGE OF ADOLESCENCE 119sperms are of two kinds. One kind has\\nan X chromosome, and the other kind\\nhas a Y chromosome.\\nSee Fig. 10.4. When a sperm\\ncontaining X chromosome fertilises the\\negg, the zygote would have two X\\nchromosomes and develop into a female\\nchild. If the sperm contributes a Y\\nchromosome to the egg (ovum) at\\nfertilisation, the zygote would develop\\ninto a male child.and ovaries to produce their hormones.\\nYou have alr eady lear nt that the\\npituitary gland is an endocrine gland.\\nIt is attached to the brain.\\nApart from the pituitary, the testes\\nand the ovaries, there are other\\nendocrine glands in the body such as\\nthyroid, pancreas and adrenals\\n(Fig. 10.5).\\nFig. 10.4 : Sex determination in humansboy girlsperms\\neggs\\nNow you know that the sex\\nchromosomes of the father determine the\\nsex of an unborn baby. The belief that\\nthe mother is responsible for the sex of\\nher baby is completely wrong and to\\nblame her for this is totally unjustified.\\n10.7 Hormones other than\\nSex Hormones\\nLook at Fig. 10.3 again.

Their aunt\\nhad told them that Kaka was suffering\\nfrom ‘goitre’, a disease of the thyroid\\ngland . Kaka’s thyroid gland was not\\nproducing the hormone thyroxine .\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 120Their aunt also told them that their\\nuncle was suffering from ‘diabetes’\\nbecause his pancreas was not producing\\nthe hormone insulin  in sufficient\\nquantities. Boojho and Paheli then\\nasked their aunt about the adrenal\\nglands, which are also shown in the\\nchart hung on the wall of her clinic. The\\naunt told them that adrenal glands\\nsecrete hormones which maintain the\\ncorrect salt balance in the blood.\\nAdrenals also produce the hormone\\nadrenalin.  It helps the body to adjust\\nto stress when one is very angry,\\nembarrassed or worried.\\nThyroid and adrenals secrete their\\nhormones when they receive orders from\\nthe pituitary through its hormones.\\nPituitary also secretes growth hormone\\nwhich is necessary for the normal\\ngrowth of a person.This change from larva to adult is\\ncalled metamorphosis  (Fig. 9.10).\\nMetamorphosis in insects is controlled\\nby insect hormones.  In a frog, it is\\ncontrolled by thyroxine, the hormone\\nproduced by thyroid.  Thyroxine\\nproduction requires the presence of\\niodine in water . If the water in which\\nthe tadpoles are growing does not\\ncontain sufficient iodine, the tadpoles\\ncannot become adults.\\nAre there hormones in\\nother animals also? Have\\nthey any role to play in\\nreproduction?If people do not have\\nenough iodine in their diet,\\nwill they get goitre caused\\nby lack of thyroxine?\\n10.8 Role of Hor mones in\\nCompleting the Life\\nHistory of Insects and\\nFrogs\\nYou have alr eady lear nt about the life\\nhistory of the silk moth and the frog.\\nThe caterpillar has to pass through\\nvarious stages to become an adult moth.\\nRecall from Class VII the stages of the\\nlife history of the silk moth.

Do you recall how we\\ncan decide whether an object is\\nmoving faster than the other? What does\\nthe distance moved by an object in unit\\ntime indicate? Y ou also know that a\\nmoving object like a ball rolling on the\\nground slows down. Sometimes it may\\nchange its direction of motion. It is also\\npossible that the ball may slow down\\nand also change its direction. Have you\\never wondered what makes an object\\nslow down or go faster , or change its\\ndirection of motion?\\nLet us recall some of our everyday\\nexperiences. What do you do to make\\na football move? What do you do to\\nmake a moving ball move faster? How\\ndoes a  goalkeeper stop a ball ? A\\nhockey player changes the direction\\nof the moving ball with a flick of the\\nstick . How do fielders stop a ball hitby a batsman?  (Fig. 11.1). In all these\\nsituations the ball is either made to\\nmove faster or slower or its direction\\nof motion is changed.\\nWe often say that a for ce has been\\napplied on a ball when it is kicked,\\npushed, thrown or flicked.

Is it a\\npull or a push?Do you notice that each of the actions\\ncan be grouped as a pull or a push or\\nboth? Can we infer from this, that to move\\nan object, it has to be pushed or pulled?\\nIn science, a push or a pull on an\\nobject is called a force . Thus, we can\\nsay that the motion imparted to objects\\nwas due to the action of a force. When\\ndoes a force come into play? Let us\\nfind out.\\n2018-19\\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 129Fig 11.3 (b) :  Who is pulling whom ?\\n11.2 Forces are due to an\\nInteraction\\nSuppose a man is standing behind a\\nstationary car [Fig.11.2(a)].

The car may begin to move in theFig. 11.3 shows three situations that\\nmay be familiar to you. Can you decide\\nwho is pulling and who is pushing in\\nthese cases?

Similarly, the cow\\nand the man in Fig. 11. 3(c) appear to\\npull each other . The girls in the two\\nsituations shown here are applying force\\non each other . Is it also true for the man\\nand the cow?\\nFrom these examples, we can infer\\nthat at least two objects must interact\\nfor a force to come into play. Thus, an\\ninteraction of one object with another\\nobject results in a force between the\\ntwo objects.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 130Does it mean that the net\\nforce on an object is zero if the\\ntwo forces acting on it in\\nopposite directions are equal?\\nrope in their direction. Sometimes the rope\\nsimply does not move. Is it not similar to\\nthe situation shown in Fig. 11.3 (b)? The\\nteam that pulls har der, that is, applies a\\nlarger force, finally wins the game.\\nWhat do these examples suggest\\nabout the nature of force?\\nForces applied on an object in the\\nsame dir ection add  to one another . Now\\nrecall what happened when you and\\nyour friend pushed the heavy box in the\\nsame direction in Activity 11.2.\\nIf the two forces act in the opposite\\ndirections on an object, the net force acting\\non it is the difference between the two\\nforces . What did you observe in Activity\\n11.2 when both of you were pushing the\\nheavy box from opposite directions?\\nRecall that in the tug-of-war when\\ntwo teams pull equally hard, the rope\\ndoes not move in any direction.\\nSo, we learn that a force could be larger\\nor smaller than the other  or equal to each\\nother . The str ength of a for ce is usually\\nexpressed by its magnitude . We have also\\nto specify the direction in which a force acts.\\nAlso, if the direction or the magnitude of the\\napplied force changes, its effect also changes.Activity 11.2\\nChoose a heavy object like a table\\nor a box, which you can move only\\nby pushing har d.

However , the\\neffect on the object is due to the net\\nforce acting on it.\\n11.4 A Force can Change the\\nState of Motion\\nLet us now find out what happens when\\na force acts on an object.\\nActivity 11.3\\nTake a rubber ball and place it on a\\nlevel sur face such as a table top or\\na concr ete floor . Now, gently push\\nthe ball along the level sur face\\n(Fig. 11.6). Does the ball begin to\\nmove? Push the ball again while it\\nis still moving. Is there any change\\nin its speed? Does it increase or\\ndecrease?\\nNext, place your palm in front\\nof the moving ball. Remove your\\npalm as soon as the moving ball\\ntouches it. Does your palm apply a\\nforce on the ball? What happens to\\nthe speed of the ball now? Does it\\nincrease or decrease? What would\\nhappen if you let your palm hold\\nthe moving ball?\\nFig. 11.6  :  A ball at rest begins to move\\nwhen a force is applied on itI have seen\\nchildren competing with one\\nanother in moving a rubber tyre\\nor a ring by pushing it\\n(Fig. 11.7).  I now understand\\nwhy the speed of the tyre\\nincreases whenever it is\\npushed.\\nFig. 11.7 : To move a tyre faster it has to be\\npushed repeatedly\\nYou might r ecall similar situations.\\nFor example, while taking a penalty kick\\nin football, the player applies a force on\\nthe ball. Before being hit, the ball was at\\nrest and so its speed was zero. The\\napplied force makes the ball move\\ntowards the goal. Suppose, the\\ngoalkeeper dives or jumps up to save the\\ngoal. By his action the goalkeeper tries\\nto apply a force on the moving ball. The\\nforce applied by him can stop or deflect\\nthe ball, saving a goal being scored. If\\nthe goalkeeper succeeds in stopping the\\nball, its speed decreases to zero.\\nThese observations suggest that a\\nforce applied on an object may change\\nits speed. If the force applied on the object\\nis in the direction of its motion, the speed\\nof the object increases. If the force is\\napplied in the direction opposite to the\\ndirection of motion, then it results in a\\ndecrease in the speed of the object.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 132Let us consider some more\\nexamples. In a game of volleyball,\\nplayers often push the moving ball to\\ntheir team  mates to make a winning\\nmove. Sometimes the ball is returned\\nto the other side of the court by\\npushing or smashing it. In cricket,  a\\nbatsman plays his or her shot by\\napplying a force on the ball with the\\nbat. Is there any change in the\\ndirection of motion of the ball in these\\ncases? In all these examples the speed\\nand the direction of the moving ball\\nchange due to the application of a\\nforce. Can you give a few more\\nexamples of this kind?\\nA change in either the speed of an\\nobject, or its direction of motion, or both,\\nis described as a change in its state of\\nmotion . Thus, a force may bring a\\nchange in the state of motion of an\\nobject.\\nFig. 11.8 : (a) A ball set in motion by\\npushing it along a level surface\\nand (b) the direction of motion\\nof the ball after it strikes the\\nruler placed in its path(a)State of Motion\\nThe state of motion of an object is\\ndescribed by its speed and the\\ndirection of motion. The state of rest\\nis considered to be the state of zero\\nspeed. An object may be at rest or in\\nmotion; both are its states of motion.Paheli is curious to know whether\\napplication of a force can only change the\\nspeed of an object. Let us find out.\\nActivity 11.4\\nTake a ball and place it on a level\\nsurface as you did in Activity 11.3.\\nMake the ball move by giving it a\\npush [Fig. 11.8(a)]. Now place a ruler\\nin its path as shown in Fig. 11.8(b).\\nIn doing so, you would apply a force\\non the moving ball. Does the ball\\ncontinue to move in the same\\ndirection after it strikes the ruler?\\nRepeat the activity and try to\\nobstruct the moving ball by placing\\nthe ruler in such a way that it\\nmakes different angles to its path.\\nIn each case note your observations\\nabout the direction of motion of the\\nball after it strikes the ruler .\\n(b)Does it mean that the application of\\na force would always result in a change\\nin the state of motion of the object? Let\\nus find out.\\nIt is common experience that many\\na time application of force does not result\\nin a change in the state of motion. For\\nexample, a heavy box may not move at\\nall even if you apply the maximum force\\nthat you can exert. Again, no effect of\\nforce is observed when you try to push\\na wall.\\n2018-19\\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 13311.5 Force can Change the\\nShape of an Object\\nDescription of\\nSituationHow to Apply\\nForceDiagram Action of Force\\nChange in\\nState of\\nMotionChange in\\nShape\\nYes No Yes No\\nA lump of dough on\\na plate.\\nSpring fixed to the\\nseat of a bicycle.\\nA rubber band\\nsuspended from a\\nhook/nail fixed on a\\nwall.\\nA plastic or metal\\nscale placed\\nbetween two bricks.Pressing it down\\nwith your hands.\\nBy sitting on the\\nseat.\\nBy hanging a\\nweight or by\\npulling its free end.\\nBy putting a weight\\nat the centre of the\\nscale.Table 11.2 : Studying the Effect of Force on Objects\\nActivity 11.5\\nSome situations have been given in Column 1 of Table 11.2 in which\\nobjects are not free to move.

Can you lift\\na bucket of water without holding it?\\nGenerally, to apply a force on an object,\\nyour body has to be in contact with the\\nobject. The contact may also be with thehelp of a stick or a piece of rope.  When\\nwe push an object like a school bag or\\nlift a bucket of water, wher e does the\\nforce come from? This force is caused\\nby the action of muscles in our body.\\nThe force resulting due to the action of\\nmuscles is known as the muscular\\nforce .\\nIt is the muscular force that enables\\nus to perform all activities involving\\nmovement or bending of our body. In\\nClass VII you have learnt that in the\\nprocess of digestion the food gets\\npushed through the alimentary canal.\\nCould it be a muscular force that does\\nit? You also know that lungs expand\\nand contract while we inhale and\\nexhale air during breathing. Where\\nare these muscles located which\\nmake breathing possible? Can you list\\na few more examples of the force\\nexerted by the muscles in our body?\\nAnimals also make use of muscular\\nforce to carry out their physical activities\\nand other tasks. Animals like bullocks,\\nhorses, donkeys and camels are used to\\nperform various tasks for us. In\\nper\\nforming these tasks they use\\nmuscular force (Fig. 11.9).\\n2018-19\\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 135Since muscular force can be applied\\nonly when it is in contact with an object,\\nit is also called a contact force . Are there\\nother types of contact forces? Let us find\\nout.\\nFriction\\nRecall some of your experiences. A ball\\nrolling along the ground gradually slows\\ndown and finally comes to rest. When\\nwe stop pedalling a bicycle, it gradually\\nslows down and finally comes to a stop.\\nA car or a scooter also comes to rest\\nonce its engine is switched off. Similarly,\\na boat comes to rest if we stop rowing\\nit. Can you add some more such\\nexperiences?\\nIn all these situations no force\\nappears to be acting on the objects, yet\\ntheir speed gradually decreases and\\nthey come to rest after some time. What\\ncauses a change in their state of motion?\\nCould some force be acting on them!\\nCan you guess the direction in which\\nthe force must be acting in each case?\\nThe force responsible for changing the\\nstate of motion of objects in all these\\nexamples is the force of friction . It is the\\nforce of friction between the sur face of\\nthe ball and the ground that brings the\\nmoving ball to rest. Similarly, friction\\nbetween water and the boat brings it to\\na stop once you stop rowing.\\nThe force of friction always acts on\\nall the moving objects and its direction\\nis always opposite to the direction of\\nmotion. Since the force of friction arises\\ndue to contact between sur faces, it is\\nalso an example of a contact for\\nce. You\\nwill learn more about this force in\\nChapter 12.\\nYou may be wondering whether it is\\nessential for the agent applying a forceon an object to be always in contact with\\nit. Let us find out.\\n11.7 Non-contact Forces\\nMagnetic Force\\nActivity 11.6\\nTake a pair of bar magnets. Place\\nthe longer side of one of the magnets\\nover three round shaped pencils or\\nwooden rollers as shown in\\nFig.11.10. Now bring one end of the\\nother magnet near the end of the\\nmagnet placed on the rollers. Make\\nsure that the two magnets do not\\ntouch each other . Observe what\\nhappens. Next, bring the other end\\nof the magnet near the same end of\\nthe magnet placed on the rollers\\n(Fig.11.10). Note what happens to\\nthe magnet placed on the rollers\\nevery time another magnet is\\nbrought near it.\\nFig.11.10 :  Observing attraction and repulsion\\nbetween two magnets\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 136 Fig.11.11 : A straw rubbed with paper attracts\\nanother straw but repels it if it has\\nalso been rubbed with a sheet of\\npaper\\nA straw is said to have acquired\\nelectrostatic charge after it has been\\nrubbed with a sheet of paper . Such a\\nstraw is an example of a charged body.\\nThe force exerted by a charged body\\non another charged or uncharged body\\nis known as electrostatic force . This\\nforce comes into play even when the\\nbodies are not in contact. The\\nelectrostatic force, therefore, is another\\nexample of a non-contact for ce. You will\\nlearn more about electric charges in\\nChapter 15.\\nGravitational Force\\nYou know that a coin or a pen falls to the\\nground when it slips off your hand.\\nL\\neaves and fruits also fall to the ground\\nwhen they get detached from the plant.\\nHave you ever wondered why it is so?\\nWhen the coin is held in your hand it\\nis at rest. As soon as it is released, it\\nbegins to move downwards. It is clear that\\nthe state of motion of the coin undergoes\\na change. Can this happen without a\\nforce acting on it?  Which is this force?Does the magnet on the rollers begin\\nto move when the other magnet is brought\\nnear it? Does it always move in the\\ndirection of the approaching magnet?\\nWhat do these observations suggest? Does\\nit mean that some force must be acting\\nbetween the two magnets?\\nYou have lear nt in Class VI that like\\npoles of two magnets repel each other and\\nunlike poles attract each other . Attraction\\nor repulsion between objects can also be\\nseen as another form of pull or push. Do\\nyou have to bring the magnets in contact\\nfor observing the force between them? A\\nmagnet can exert a force on another\\nmagnet without being in contact with it.\\nThe force exerted by a magnet is an\\nexample of a non-contact force .\\nSimilarly, the force exerted by a\\nmagnet on a piece of iron is also a non-\\ncontact force.\\nElectrostatic Force\\nActivity 11.7\\nTake a plastic straw and cut it into\\nnearly two equal pieces. Suspend one\\nof the pieces from the edge of a table\\nwith the help of a piece of thread (Fig.\\n11.11). Now hold the other piece of\\nstraw in your hand and rub its free\\nend with a sheet of paper . Bring the\\nrubbed end of the straw near the\\nsuspended straw. Make sure that the\\ntwo pieces do not touch each other .\\nWhat do you observe?\\nNext, rub the free end of the\\nsuspended piece of straw with a\\nsheet of paper .

What do you\\nobserve now?\\n2018-19\\nFORCE AND PRESSURE 137Objects or things fall towards the\\nearth because it pulls them. This force\\nis called the force of gravity , or just\\ngravity . This is an attractive force. The\\nforce of gravity acts on all objects. The\\nforce of gravity acts on all of us all the\\ntime without our being awar e of it. W ater\\nbegins to flow towards the ground as\\nsoon as we open a tap. W ater in rivers\\nflows downward due to the force of\\ngravity.Try cutting vegetables with a blunt\\nknife  and then with a sharp knife. Which\\nis easier?\\nDo you get the feeling that the area\\nover which the force is applied (for\\nexample, the pointed end of the nail)\\nplays  a role in making these tasks easier?\\nThe force acting on a unit area of a\\nsurface is called \\npressure.\\npressure = force / area on which it acts\\nAt this stage we consider only those\\nforces which act perpendicular to the\\nsurface on which the pressure is to\\nbe computed.Gravity is not a property of the earth\\nalone.

Let us find out.\\nTry to push a nail into a wooden\\nplank by its head. Did you succeed? T ry\\nnow to push the nail by the pointed end\\n(Fig. 11.12). Could you do it this time?\\nI now understand why\\nporters place a round piece\\nof cloth on their heads,\\nwhen they have to carry\\nheavy loads (Fig. 11.13). By\\ndoing this they increase the\\narea of contact of the load\\nwith their head. So, the\\npressure on their head is\\nreduced and they find it\\neasier to carry the load.\\nFig. 11.13 : A porter carrying a heavy load\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 138Note that the area is in the\\ndenominator in the above expression.\\nSo, the smaller the area, larger the\\npressur e on a sur face for the same for ce.\\nThe area of the pointed end of the nail\\nis much smaller than that of its head.\\nThe same force, therefore, produces a\\npressure sufficient to push the pointed\\nend of the nail into the wooden plank.\\nCan you explain now why shoulder\\nbags are provided with broad straps and\\nnot thin strap? And, why the tools\\nmeant for cutting and piercing always\\nhave sharp edges?\\nDo liquids and gases also exert\\npressure? Does it also depend on the\\narea on which the force acts?

The pr essure\\nexerted by this air is known as\\natmospheric pr essur\\ne. We know that\\npressure is force per unit area. If we\\nimagine a unit area and a very long\\ncylinder standing on it filled with air ,\\nthen the force of gravity on the air in\\nthis cylinder is the atmospheric\\npressure (Fig. 11.17).\\nFig.11.18 : A rubber sucker pressed on a\\nsurface\\nWhen you pr ess the sucker , most of\\nthe air between its cup and the sur face\\nescapes out.

Then he\\nemployed eight horses on each hemisphere to pull them apart (Fig. 11.20).

Put your hand on\\nyour throat as shown in Fig. 13.8. Do\\nyou feel any vibrations?\\nIn humans, the sound is produced\\nby the voice box  or the larynx . Put your\\nfingers on the throat and find a hard\\nbump that seems to move when you\\nswallow. This part of the body is known\\nas the voice box. It is at the upper end\\nof the windpipe . Two vocal cords,\\n are\\nstretched across the voice box or larynx\\nin such a way that it leaves a narrow\\nslit between them for the passage of air\\n(Fig.13.8).\\nFig. 13.7 :  Jaltrang\\nWhen we pluck the string of an\\ninstrument, like the sitar , the sound\\nthat we hear is not only that of the\\nstring. The whole instrument is forced\\nto vibrate, and it is the sound of the\\nvibration of the instrument that we\\nhear. Similarly, when we strike the\\nmembrane of a mridangam\\n, the sound\\nthat we hear is not only that of the\\nmembrane but of the whole body of\\nthe instrument.When we speak, does\\nany part of our body\\nvibrate?\\nFig.13.8 : Voice box in humans\\nWhen the lungs force air through the\\nslit, the vocal cords vibrate, producing\\nsound.

In fact, sound\\ncan travel thr ough any solid. Y ou can\\nperform inter esting activities to show\\nthat sound can also travel through\\nstrings. Have you ever made a toy\\ntelephone (Fig. 13.14). Can you say that\\nsound can travel through strings?\\nFig. 13.14 : A toy telephone\\nWe have lear nt so far that vibrating\\nobjects produce sound and it is carried\\nin all directions in a medium. The\\nmedium could be a gas, a liquid or a\\nsolid. How do we hear it?\\nFig. 13.15 : Understanding action of an eardrum13.4 We Hear Sound thr ough\\nOur Ears\\nThe shape of the outer part of the ear is\\nlike a funnel. When sound enters it, it\\ntravels down a canal at the end of which\\nthere is a thin stretched membrane. It\\nis called the eardrum. It per forms an\\nimportant function. To understand what\\nthe eardrum does, let us build a tin-can\\nmodel of the eardrum.\\nActivity 13.10\\nTake a plastic or tin-can. Cut its\\nends. Stretch a piece of rubber\\nballoon across one end of the can\\nand fasten it with a rubber band.\\nPut four or five grains of dry cereal\\non the str etched rubber . Now ask\\nyour friend to speak “Hurrey,\\nHurrey” from the open end\\n(Fig.13.15). Observe what  happens\\nto the grain. Why do the grains\\njump up and down?\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 164The eardrum is like a stretched\\nrubber sheet. Sound vibrations make\\nthe eardrum vibrate (Fig. 13.16). The\\neardrum sends vibrations to the inner\\near. From ther e, the signal goes to the\\nbrain. That is how we hear .You have alr eady lear nt in earlier classes\\nabout the oscillatory motion and its\\ntime period .\\nThe number of oscillations  per\\nsecond is called the \\nfrequency  of\\noscillation. Frequency is expressed in\\nhertz. Its symbol is Hz. A frequency of\\n1 Hz is one oscillation per second. If an\\nobject oscillates 20 times in one second,\\nwhat would be its frequency?\\nYou can r ecognise many familiar\\nsounds without seeing the objects\\nproducing them. How is it possible?\\nThese sounds must be different to\\nenable you to recognise them. Have you\\never thought what factors make them\\ndifferent?  Amplitude  and frequency are\\ntwo important properties of any sound.\\nCan we differentiate sounds on the basis\\nof their amplitudes and frequencies?\\nLoudness and Pitch\\nActivity 13.11\\nTake a metallic tumbler and a\\ntablespoon.

Is the\\nsound louder when the tumbler is\\nstruck hard?\\nNow suspend a small thermocol\\nball touching the rim of the tumbler\\n(Fig. 13.17). Vibrate the tumbler by\\nstriking it. See how far the ball is\\ndisplaced. The displacement of the\\nball is a measure of the amplitude\\nof vibration of the tumbler .\\nNow, strike the tumbler gently\\nand then a little har der. Compar e\\nthe amplitudes of vibrations of the\\ntumbler in the two cases. In which\\ncase is the amplitude larger?\\nLoudness of sound is proportional to\\nthe square of the amplitude of the\\nvibration producing the sound. For\\nexample, if the amplitude becomes\\ntwice, the loudness increases by a\\nfactor of 4. The loudness is expressed\\nin a unit called decibel (dB). The\\nfollowing table gives some idea of the\\nloudness of sound coming from\\nvarious sources.\\nNormal breathing 10 dB\\nSoft whisper (at 5m) 30 dB\\nNormal conversation 60 dB\\nBusy traffic 70 dB\\nAverage factory 80 dB\\nAbove 80 dB the noise becomes\\nphysically painful.I wonder why my voice\\nis different from that of\\nmy teacher .\\nCompare the sound of a baby with\\nthat of an adult. Is there any difference?\\nEven if two sounds are equally loud,\\nthey differ in some way. Let us see how.\\nFig. 13.18 : Frequency determines the\\npitch of a soundThe loudness of sound depends on\\nits amplitude. When the amplitude of\\nvibration is large, the sound produced\\nis loud. When the amplitude is small,\\nthe sound produced is feeble.The frequency determines the\\nshrillness  or pitch\\n of a sound. If the\\nfrequency of vibration is higher we say\\nthat the sound is shrill and has a higher\\npitch. If the frequency of vibration is\\nlower , we say that the sound has a lower\\npitch. For example, a drum vibrates with\\na low frequency. Therefore, it produces\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 166a low-pitched sound. On the other\\nhand, a whistle has a high frequency\\nand therefore, produces a sound of\\nhigher pitch (Fig. 13.18). A bird makes\\na high-pitched sound whereas a lion\\nmakes a low-pitched r oar. However , the\\nroar of a lion is very loud while the\\nsound of the bird is quite feeble.\\nEvery day you hear the voices of\\nchildren and adults. Do you find any\\ndifference in their voices? Can you say\\nthat the frequency of the voice of a child\\nis higher than that of an adult?\\nUsually the voice of a woman has\\na higher  frequency than that of a\\nman.\\n13.6 Audible and Inaudible\\nSounds\\nWe know that we need a vibrating body\\nfor the production of sound. Can we\\nhear the sound of all vibrating bodies?\\nThe fact is that sounds of frequencies\\nless than about 20 vibrations per second\\n(20 Hz) cannot be detected by the  human\\near. Such sounds ar e called ina u\\ndible.\\nOn the higher side, sounds of  frequencies\\nhigher than about 20,000 vibrations per\\nsecond (20 kHz) are also not audible to\\nthe  human ear . Thus, for human ear ,\\nthe range of audible frequencies is\\nroughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz.\\nSome animals can hear sounds of\\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.\\nDogs have this ability. The police use\\nhigh frequency whistles which dogs can\\nhear but humans cannot.\\nThe ultrasound equipment, familiar\\nto us for investigating and tracking\\nmany medical problems, works at\\nfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.13.7 Noise and Music\\nWe hear dif ferent types of sounds\\naround us. Is the sound always\\npleasing? Does a sound sometimes\\ncause discomfort to you? Some sounds\\nare pleasant to the ear , wher eas some\\nare not.\\nSuppose construction work is going\\non in your neighbourhood. Are the\\nsounds coming from the construction\\nsite pleasin g? Do you enjoy the sounds\\nproduced by horns of buses and trucks?\\nSuch unpleasant sounds are called\\nnoise . In a classroom, if all the students\\nspeak together , what would the sound\\nproduced be called?\\nOn the other hand you enjoy sounds\\nfrom musical instruments.  Musical\\nsound is one which is pleasing to the\\near. Sound produced by a har\\nmonium\\nis a musical sound. The string of a sitar\\nalso gives out a musical sound.  But, if\\na musical sound becomes too loud,\\nwould it remain melodious ?\\n13.8 Noise Pollution\\nYou alr eady know about air pollution.\\nPresence of unwanted gases and\\nparticles in air is called air pollution.\\nSimilarly, presence of excessive or\\nunwanted sounds in the environment\\nis called noise pollution. Can you list\\nsome sources of noise pollution? Major\\ncauses of noise pollution are sounds of\\nvehicles, explosions including bursting\\nof crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc.\\nWhat sources in the home may lead to\\nnoise? Television and transistor radio\\nat high volumes, some kitchen\\nappliances, desert coolers, air\\nconditioners, all contribute to noise\\npollution.\\n2018-19\\nSOUND 167Hearing Impairment\\nTotal hearing impairment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partial\\ndisability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with\\nimpaired hearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children\\ncan communicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of\\nhearing, a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also.\\nTechnological devices for the hearing-impaired have made it possible for such\\npersons to improve their quality of life. S ociety can do much to  improve the\\nliving environment for the hearing-impaired and help them live normal lives.What are the Harms of Noise\\nPollution?\\nDo you know that presence of excessive\\nnoise in the surroundings may cause\\nmany health related problems. Lack of\\nsleep, hypertension (high blood-\\npressure), anxiety and many more health\\ndisorders may be caused by noise\\npollution. A person who is exposed to a\\nloud sound continuously may get\\ntemporary or even permanent\\nimpairment of hearing.\\nMeasures to Limit Noise Pollution\\nTo control noise, we  must control the\\nsources of noise. How can this be\\nachieved? For this, silencing devicesmust be installed in air  craft engines,\\ntransport vehicles, industrial\\nmachines and home appliances.\\nHow can the noise pollution be\\ncontrolled in a residential area?\\nAll noisy operations must be\\nconducted away from any residential\\narea. Noise producing industries\\nshould be set up away from such\\nareas. Use of automobile horns\\nshould be minimi s\\ned. TV and music\\nsystems should be run at low\\nvolumes. Trees must be planted along\\nthe roads and around buildings to\\ncut down on the sounds reaching the\\nresidents, thus reducing the harmful\\neffects of noise pollution.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 168\\n KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS\\nAMPLITUDE\\nEARDRUM\\nFREQUENCY\\nhertz  (Hz)\\nLARYNX\\nLOUDNESS\\nNOISE\\nOSCILLA TION\\nPITCH\\nTIME PERIOD\\nVIBRA TION\\nVOICE BOX\\nWIND PIPE WHA  WHA WHA  WHA WHA T YT YT Y T YT YOU HA OU HAOU HA OU HAOU HA VE LEARNTVE LEARNTVE LEARNTVE LEARNTVE LEARNT\\n/circlerightSound is produced by vibrating objects.\\n/circlerightIn human beings, the vibration of the vocal\\ncords produces sound.\\n/circlerightSound travels through a medium (gas, liquid\\nor solid).

Let\\nus find out.\\nPaheli and Boojho want to\\nremind you that one\\nshould not experiment\\nwith the electric supply\\nfrom the mains or a\\ngenerator or an inverter .\\nUse only electric cells for\\nall the activities suggested\\nhere.\\nFig.14.1 :  A tester14.1 Do Liquids Conduct\\nElectricity?\\nTo test whether a liquid allows electric\\ncurrent to pass through it or not, we\\ncan use the same tester (Fig .14.1).\\n2018-19\\nHowever , replace the cell by a battery.\\nAlso, before using the tester we\\nshould check whether it is working\\nor not.\\nActivity 14.1\\nJoin the free ends of the tester\\ntogether for a moment. This\\ncompletes the circuit of the tester\\nand the bulb should glow.  However ,\\nif the bulb does not glow, it means\\nthat the tester is not working. Can\\nyou think of the possible reasons?\\nIs it possible that the connections\\nare loose? Or , the bulb is fused? Or ,\\nyour cells are used up? Check that\\nall the connections are tight. If they\\nare, then replace the bulb with\\nanother bulb. Now test if the tester\\nis working or not. If it is still not\\nworking then replace the cells with\\nfresh cells.\\nNow that our tester is working, let\\nus use it to test the various liquids.\\n(Caution: While checking your tester ,\\ndo not join its free ends for more than a\\nfew seconds. Otherwise the cells of the\\nbattery will drain very quickly. )\\nActivity 14.2\\nCollect a few small plastic or rubber\\ncaps of discarded bottles and clean\\nthem. Pour one teaspoon of lemon\\njuice or vinegar in one cap. Bring\\nyour tester over this cap and let the\\nends of the tester dip into lemon juice\\nor vinegar as shown in Fig.14.2.

Does the bulbFig. 14.2 :  Testing conduction of electricity in\\nlemon juice or vinegarof the tester glow? Does lemon juice\\nor vinegar conduct electricity? How\\nwould you classify lemon juice or\\nvinegar — a good conductor or a poor\\nconductor?\\nWhen the liquid between the two\\nends of the tester allows the electric\\ncurrent to pass, the circuit of the tester\\nbecomes complete. The current flows in\\nthe circuit and the bulb glows. When\\nthe liquid does not allow the electric\\ncurrent to pass, the circuit of the tester\\nis not complete and the bulb does not\\nglow.\\nIn some situations  even though the\\nliquid is conducting, the bulb may not\\nglow. It may have happened in Activity\\n14.2. What can be the reason?\\nDo you remember why the bulb\\nglows when the electric current passes\\nthrough it? Due to the heating effect\\nof current, the filament of the bulb gets\\nheated to a high temperature and it\\nstarts glowing. However\\n, if the current\\nthrough a circuit is too weak, the\\nfilament does not get heated\\nCHEMICAL  EFFECTS  OF ELECTRIC  CURRENT 173\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 174Activity 14.3\\nTake the tray from inside a discarded\\nmatchbox.

And\\nwhy is the current in the circuit weak?\\nWell, though a material may conduct\\nelectricity, it may not conduct it as\\neasily as a metal. As a result, the\\ncircuit of the tester may be complete\\nand yet the current through it may be\\ntoo weak to make the bulb glow.

She\\nwonders if air is indeed a poor\\nconductor under all conditions.\\nThis makes Boojho ask whether\\nother materials classified as\\npoor conductors also allow\\nelectricity to pass under\\ncertain conditions.\\nFrom Table 14.1, we find that some\\nliquids are good conductors of electricity\\nand some are poor conductors.\\nActually, under certain conditions\\nmost materials can conduct.

However , with r epeated use, the\\ngold coating wears off, revealing silver or\\nsome other metal beneath.\\nIn both these cases, a metal has a\\ncoating of another metal. Do you wonder\\nhow a layer of one metal can be\\ndeposited on top of another? W ell, let\\nus try doing it ourselves.\\nActivity 14.7\\nWe will need copper sulphate and\\ntwo copper plates of size around\\n10 cm × 4 cm. Take 250 mL of\\ndistilled water in a clean and dry\\nbeaker . Dissolve two teaspoonfuls of\\ncopper sulphate in it.

Connect the\\ncopper plate s to the terminals of a\\nbattery \\nand immerse them in copper\\nsulphate solution (Fig. 14.7).When electric current is passed\\nthrough the copper sulphate solution,\\ncopper sulphate dissociates into\\ncopper and sulphate. The free copper\\ngets drawn to the electrode connected\\nto the negative terminal of the battery\\nand gets deposited on it.

Can we also say that the\\ncharges of the same kind repel eachother, while char ges of dif ferent kind\\nattract each other?\\nIt is a convention to call  the charge\\nacquired by a glass rod when it isrubbed with silk as positive.

The current in a circuit whichmakes a bulb glow, or the current thatmakes a wire hot, is nothing but amotion of charges.\\n15.4 Transfer of Char ge\\nActivity 15.4\\nTake an empty jam bottle.

Do theyrepel each other or attract eachother? Now, touch other chargedbodies with the end of the paper clip.Do foil strips behave in the sameway in all cases? Can this apparatusbe used to detect whether a body ischarged or not? Can you explainwhy the foil strips repel each other?\\nThe aluminium foil strips receive the\\nsame charge from the charged refillthrough the paper clip (remember thatmetals are good conductors ofelectricity). The strips carrying similarcharges repel each other and theybecome wide open. Such a device canbe used to test whether an object iscarrying charge or not. This device isknown as electroscope .\\nThus, we find that electrical charge\\ncan be transferred from a charged objectto another thr ough a metal conductor.\\nTouch the end of the paper clip gently\\nwith hand and you will find a change in\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 188the foil strips. They come back to their\\noriginal state. Repeat charging of foilstrips and touching the paper clip. Everytime you will find that the foil stripscollapse as soon as you touch thepaperclip  with hand . Why does it\\nhappen? The reason is that the foil stripslose charge to the earth through yourbody.

The process of transfe rring\\nof charge from a charged object to theearth is called earthing .\\nEarthing is provided in buildings toprotect us from electrical shocks due\\nto any leakage of electrical current.\\n15.5 The Story of Lightning\\nIt is now possible to explain lightning\\nin terms of the charges produced by\\nrubbing.You learnt in Class VII that during\\nthe development of a thunderstorm, the\\nair currents move upward while thewater droplets move downward. Thesevigorous movements cause separation\\nof charges. By a process, not yet\\ncompletely understood, the positivecharges collect near the upper edges ofthe clouds and the negative chargesaccumulate near the lower edges. Thereis accumulation of positive charges near\\nthe ground also. When the magnitude\\nof the accumulated charges becomes verylarge, the air which is normally a poorconductor of electricity, is no longer ableto resist their flow. Negative and positivecharges meet, producing streaks of\\nbright light and sound. We see streaks\\nas lightning (Fig. 15.5). The process iscalled an electric discharge.\\nFig 15.5 : Accumulation of charges leading to lightning.\\n2018-19\\nSOME NATURAL  PHENOMENA 189\\nThe process of electric discharge can\\noccur between two or more clouds, or\\nbetween clouds and the earth. Today weneed not get frightened by lightning likeour ancestors did. Now we understandthe basic phenomenon. Scientists aretrying hard to improve thisunderstanding. However, lightningstrike could destroy life and property. Itis, therefore, necessary to take measuresto protect ourselves.\\n15.6 Lightning Safety\\nDuring lightning and thunderstorm noopen place is safe.\\n\\uf06cHearing thunder is an alert to rushto a safer place.\\n\\uf06cAfter hearing the last thunder , wait\\nfor some time before coming out ofthe safe place.\\nFinding a Safe Place\\nA house or a building is a safe place.\\nIf you are travelling by car or by bus,\\nyou are safe inside with windows and\\ndoors of the vehicle shut.\\nDo’s and Don’ts during a\\nThunderstorm\\nOutside\\nOpen vehicles, like motorbikes, tractors,\\nconstruction machinery, open cars are\\nnot safe. Open fields, tall trees, sheltersin parks, elevated places do not protect\\nus from lightning strokes.\\nCarrying an umbrella is not at all a\\ngood idea during thunderstorms.\\nIf in a forest, take shelter under\\nshorter trees.\\nIf no shelter is available and you are\\nin an open field, stay far away from alltrees. Stay away from poles or othermetal objects. Do not lie on the ground.Instead, squat low on the ground. Place\\nyour hands on your knees with yourhead between the hands (Fig. 15.6). This\\nposition will make you the smallest\\ntarget to be struck.\\nInside the house\\nLightning can strike telephone cords,\\nelectrical wires and metal pipes (Do youremember , lightning is an electrical\\ndischarge?). During a thunderstormcontact with these should be avoided. Itis safer to use mobile phones andcordless phones. However, it is not wiseto call up a person who is receiving yourphone through a wired phone.\\nBathing should be avoided during\\nthunderstorms to avoid contact withrunning water .\\nElectrical appliances like computers,\\nTVs, etc ., should be unplugged. Electrical\\nlights can remain on . They  do not cause\\nany harm.Fig. 15.6 : Safe position during lightning\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 190Lightning Conductors\\nLightning Conductor is a device used\\nto protect buildings from the effect oflightning. A metallic rod, taller than thebuilding, is installed in the walls of thebuilding during its construction. Oneend of the rod is kept out in the air andthe other is buried deep in the ground(Fig. 15.7). The rod provides easy routefor the transfer of electric charge to theground.\\nThe metal columns used during\\nconstruction, electrical wires and waterpipes in the buildings also protect us toan extent. But do not touch them duringa thunderstorm.15.7 Earthquakes\\nYou just learnt about thunderstor m and\\nlightning.  In Class VII you learnt aboutcyclones.

Theirideas were, therefore, expressed inmythical stories such as the one told byBoojho’s grandmother. Similar mythswere prevalent in other parts of theworld.The outermost layer of the earth is\\nnot in one piece.  It is fragmented.

However, most earthquakesare caused by the movement of earth’splates.\\nSince earthquakes are caused by the\\nmovement of plates, the boundaries ofthe plates are the weak zones whereearthquakes are more likely to occur.The weak zones are also known asseismic or fault zones .

These are called\\nseismic waves.  The waves are recorded by an instrument called theseismograph (Fig. 15.13).  The instrument is simply a vibrating rod, or a\\npendulum, which starts vibrating when tr emors occur.  A pen is attached to\\nthe vibrating system.  The pen records the seismic waves on a paper whichmoves under it.  By studying these waves, scientists can construct a completemap of the earthquake, as shown in  Fig. 15.14.  They can also estimate itspower to cause destruction.\\nFig. 15.13 : A seismographA typical seismograph record\\nFig. 15.14 : Map of the earthquake\\nEpicentreSeismic\\nwavesFocus\\nInside the earthEarth’sSurface\\nLike many other scales in science (decibel is another example), Richter scaleis not linear .

Set them\\nat right angles to each other with\\ntheir edges touching (Fig. 16.10). To\\nhinge them you can use adhesive\\ntape. Place a coin in between the\\nmirrors. How many images of the\\ncoin do you see (Fig. 16.10)?\\nNow hinge the mirrors using the\\nadhesive tape at different angles, say\\n45°, 60°, 120°, 180° etc. Place some\\nobject (say a candle) in between\\nthem. Note down the number of\\nimages of the object in each case.\\nFinally, set the two mirrors\\nparallel to each other . Find out how\\nmany images of a candle placed\\nbetween them are formed (Fig.\\n16.11).Fig. 16.10 : Images in plane mirror at right\\nangle to each other\\nFig. 16.11 : Image in plane mirror parallel\\nto each other\\nmirrors\\n(a)\\n(b) (c)Can you now explain how you can\\nsee the back of your head at the hair\\ndresser’s shop?\\nThis idea of number of images formed\\nby mirrors placed at an angle to one\\nanother is used in a kaleidoscope to\\nmake numer ous beautiful patter ns. You\\ncan also make a kaleidoscope yourself.\\nKaleidoscope\\nActivity 16.6\\nTo make a kaleidoscope, get three\\nrectangular mirror strips each about\\n15 cm long and 4 cm wide. Join\\nthem together to form a prism as\\nshown in Fig. 16.12(a). Fix this\\narrangement of mirrors in a circular\\ncardboard tube or tube of a thick\\nchart paper . Make sur e that the tube\\nis slightly longer than the mirror\\nstrips. Close one end of the tube by\\na cardboard disc having a hole in\\nthe centre, through which you can\\nsee [Fig. 16.12(b)]. To make the disc\\ndurable, paste a piece of transparent\\nplastic sheet under the cardboard\\nFig. 16.12 : Making a kaleidoscope\\n2018-19\\nLIGHT 205disc. At the other end, touching the\\nmirrors, fix a circular plane glass\\nplate [Fig. 16.12(c)]. Place on this\\nglass plate several small pieces of\\ncoloured glass (broken pieces of\\ncoloured bangles). Close this end of\\nthe tube by a ground glass plate.\\nAllow enough space for the colour\\npieces to move around.\\nYour kaleidoscope is r eady. When\\nyou peep through the hole, you will be\\nable to see a variety of patterns in the\\ntube. An interesting feature of a\\nkaleidoscope is that you will never see\\nthe same pattern again. Designers of\\nwallpapers and fabrics and artists often\\nuse kaleidoscopes to get ideas for new\\npatterns. To make your toy attractive,\\nyou can wrap the kaleidoscope in a\\ncolour ed paper .16.6 Sunlight — White or\\nColoured\\nIn Class VII, you learnt that the sunlight\\nis referr\\ned to as white light. Y ou also\\nlearnt that it consists of seven colours.\\nHere is another activity (Activity 16.7)\\nshowing that sunlight consists of several\\ncolours.\\n16.7 What is inside Our Eyes?\\nWe see things only when light coming\\nfrom them enters our eyes. Eye is one\\nof our most important sense organs. It\\nis, therefore, important to understand\\nits structure and working.\\nThe eye has a roughly spherical\\nshape. The outer coat of the eye is\\nwhite. It is tough so that it can protect\\nthe interior of the eye from accidents.\\nIts transparent front part is called\\nActivity 16.7\\nFig. 16.13 : Dispersion of lightGet a plane mirror of a suitable size.\\nPlace it in a bowl ( katori) as shown\\nin Fig. 16.13. Fill the bowl with water .\\nPut this arrangement near a window\\nin such a way that direct sunlight\\nfalls on the mirr or. Adjust the\\nposition of the bowl\\nso that the reflected\\nlight from the\\nmirror falls on a\\nwall. If the wall is\\nnot white, fix a sheet\\nof white paper on it.\\nReflected light will\\nbe seen to have\\nmany colours. How\\ncan you explain\\nthis? The mirror\\nand water form aprism. A\\ns you learnt in Class VII ,\\nthis breaks up the light into its\\ncolours,  Splitting of light into its\\ncolours is known as dispersion  of\\nlight. Rainbow is a natural\\nphenomenon showing dispersion.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 206Fig. 16.15 : Demonstration of blind spotCaution : For this activity, never use\\na laser torch.\\nActivity 16.8\\nLook into your friend’s eye. Observe\\nthe size of the pupil. Throw light on\\nher eye with a torch. Observe the\\npupil now. Switch off the torch, and\\nobserve her pupil once again. Do\\nyou notice any change in the size\\nof the pupil? In which case was the\\npupil larger? Why do you think it\\nwas so?\\nIn which case do you need to\\nallow more light in the eye, when\\nthe light is dim or bright?\\nBehind the pupil of the eye is a lens\\nwhich is thicker in the centre. What\\nkind of lens is thicker at the centre?\\nRecall what you learnt about lenses incornea  (Fig. 16.14).  Behind the cornea,\\nwe find a dark muscular structure\\ncalled iris. In the iris, there is a small\\nopening called the pupil. The size of\\nthe pupil is controlled by the iris. The\\niris is that part of eye which gives it its\\ndistinctive colour . When we say that a\\nperson has green eyes, we refer actually\\nto the colour of the iris. The iris controls\\nthe amount of light entering into the\\neye. Let us see how.\\nIris\\nLens\\nCiliary\\nmuscle\\nCornea\\nRetinaOptic\\nNerve\\nFig. 16.14 : Human eyeClass VII. The lens focuses light on the\\nback of the eye, on a layer  called retina\\n(Fig. 16.14). The retina contains several\\nnerve cells. Sensations felt by the nerve\\ncells are then transmitted to the brain\\nthrough the optic nerve. There are two\\nkinds of cells–\\n(i)cones, which are sensitive to bright\\nlight and\\n(ii)rods, which are sensitive to dim light.\\nCones sense colour . At the junction\\nof the optic nerve and the retina, there\\nare no sensory cells, so no vision is\\npossible at that spot. This is called the\\nblind spot . Its existence can be\\ndemonstrated as follows:\\nActivity 16.9\\nMake a round mark and a cross on\\na sheet of paper with the spot to the\\nright of the cross (Fig. 16.15). The\\ndistance between two marks may be\\n6-8 cm. Hold the sheet of paper at\\nan arm’s length from the eye. Close\\nyour left eye. Look continuously at\\nthe cross. Move the sheet slowly\\ntowards you, keeping your eye on\\nthe cross. What do you find? Does\\nthe round mark disappear at some\\npoint? Now close your right eye.\\nLook at the round mark now and\\nrepeat the activity. Does the cross\\ndisappear? The disappearance of the\\ncross or the round mark shows that\\nthere is a point on the retina which\\ncannot send messages to the brain\\nwhen light falls on it.\\n2018-19\\nLIGHT 207Nature has provided eyes with\\neyelids to prevent any object from\\nentering the eye. Eyelids also shut out\\nlight when not required.\\nEye is such a wonder\\nful instrument\\nthat it (normal) can clearly see distant\\nobjects as well as objects nearby . The\\nminimum distance at which the eye can\\nsee objects distinctly varies with age. The\\nmost comfortable distance at which one\\ncan read with a normal eye is about\\n25 cm.\\nSome persons can see objects close\\nto them clearly but cannot see distant\\nobjects so clearly. On the other hand,\\nsome persons cannot see objects nearby\\nclearly but they can see distant objects\\nquite well. With suitable corrective\\nlenses, these defects of the eye can be\\ncorrected.\\nSometimes, particularly in old age,\\neyesight becomes foggy. It is due to the\\neye lens becoming cloudy. When it\\nhappens, persons are said to have\\ncataract. There is a loss of vision,\\nsometimes extremely severe. It is\\npossible to treat this defect. The opaque\\nlens is removed and a new artificial\\nlens is inserted. Modern technology\\nhas made this procedure simpler\\nand safer .\\n16.8 Care of the Eyes\\nIt is necessary that you take proper care\\nof your eyes. If there is any problem\\nyou should go to an eye specialist. Have\\na regular checkup—\\n/circle6If advised, use suitable spectacles.\\n/circle6Too little or too much light is bad\\nfor eyes. Insufficient light causes\\neyestrain and headaches. Too much\\nlight, like that of the Sun, a power fulThe movies that we see are actually\\na number of separate pictures in\\nproper sequence. They are made to\\nmove across the eye usually at the rate\\nof 24 pictures  per second (faster than\\n16 per second). So, we see a moving\\npicture.\\nFront side of\\ncardboardReverse side\\nof cardboardThe impression of an image does not\\nvanish immediately from the retina. It\\npersists there for about 1/16th of a\\nsecond. So, if still images of a moving\\nobject are flashed on the eye at a rate\\nfaster than 16 per second, then the eye\\nperceives this object as moving.\\nActivity 16.10\\nGet a square piece of cardboard of\\nsize 6-8 cm. Make two holes as\\nshown in Fig. 16.16. Thread a\\nstring through the two holes. Draw/\\npaste a cage on one side of the\\ncardboard and a bird on the other\\nside.

Do not read by bringing\\nthe book too close to your eyes or\\nkeeping it too far .\\nYou lear nt about balanced diet in\\nClass VI. If food is deficient in some\\ncomponents, eyes may also suf fer. Lack\\nof vitamin A in foodstuff is responsible\\nfor many eye troubles.  Most common\\namongst them is night blindness.\\nOne should, therefore, include in the\\ndiet components which have vitamin A.\\nRaw carrots, broccoli and greenDid you know?\\nAnimals have eyes shaped in different ways. Eyes of a crab are quite small but\\nthey enable the crab to look all around. So, the crab can sense even if the enemy\\napproaches from behind. Butterflies have large eyes that seem to be made up of\\nthousands of little eyes (Fig.\\n16.17). They can see not only in\\nthe front and the sides but the\\nback as well.\\nA night bird (owl) can see very\\nwell in the night but not during\\nthe day. On the other hand, day\\nlight birds (kite, eagle) can see\\nwell during the day but not in the\\nnight. The owl has a large cornea\\nand a large pupil to allow more\\nlight in its eye. Also, it has on its\\nretina a large number of rods and\\nonly a few cones. The day birds\\non the other hand, have more\\ncones and fewer rods.Fig. 16.17 : Eyes of a butterfly\\nEyes\\nvegetables (such as spinach) and cod\\nliver oil are rich in vitamin A. Eggs,\\nmilk, curd, cheese, butter and fruits\\nsuch as papaya and mango are also rich\\nin vitamin A.\\n16.9 Visually Impaired\\nPersons Can Read and\\nWrite\\nSome persons, including children, can\\nbe visually impaired. They have very\\nlimited vision to see things. Some\\npersons cannot see at all since birth.\\nSome persons may lose their eyesight\\nbecause of a disease or an injury. Such\\npersons try to identify things by\\ntouching and listening to voices more\\ncarefully. They develop their other\\nsenses mor e sharply. However ,\\nadditional resources can enable them\\nto develop their capabilities further .\\n2018-19\\nLIGHT 20916.10 What is the Braille\\nSystem?\\nThe most popular resource for visually\\nchallenged persons is Braille .\\nLouis Braille\\nLouis Braille, himself a visually\\nchallenged person, developed a\\nsystem for visually challenged persons\\nand published it in 1821.Non-optical and optical aids for visually impaired\\nNon-optical aids include visual aids, tactual aids (using the sense of touch),\\nauditory aids (using the sense of hearing) and electronic aids. Visual aids, can\\nmagnify words, can provide suitable intensity of light and material at proper distances.\\nTactual aids, including Braille writer slate and stylus, help the visually challenged\\npersons in taking notes, reading and writing. Auditory aids include cassettes, tape\\nrecorders, talking books and other such devices. Electronic aids, such as talking\\ncalculators  and computers , are also available for performing many computational\\ntasks. Closed circuit television, also an electronic aid, enlarges printed material\\nwith suitable contrast and illumination. Nowadays, use of audio CDs and voice boxes\\nwith computers are also very helpful for listening to and writing the desired text.\\nOptical aids include bifocal lenses, contact lenses, tinted lenses, magnifiers\\nand telescopic aids. While the lens combinations are used to rectify visual\\nlimitations, telescopic aids are available to view chalkboard and class\\ndemonstrations.\\nFig. 16.18 : Example of dot patterns used\\nin Braille SystemBraille system has 63 dot patterns or\\ncharacters. Each character\\nrepresents a letter , a combination of\\nletters, a common word or a\\ngrammatical sign. Dots are arranged\\nin cells of two vertical rows of three\\ndots each.\\nPatterns of dots to represent some\\nEnglish letters and some common\\nwords are shown below.\\nThese patterns when embossed on\\nBraille sheets help visually\\nchallenged persons to recognise words\\nby touching. To make them easier to\\ntouch, the dots are raised slightly.The present system was adopted in\\n1932. There is Braille code for common\\nlanguages, mathematics and scientific\\nnotation. Many Indian languages can\\nbe read using the Braille system.\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 210\\nSome visually impaired Indians have great achievements to their\\ncredit. Diwakar , a child pr odigy has given amazing per formances\\nas a singer .\\nRavindra Jain, born completely visually impaired, obtained\\nhis Sangeet Prabhakar degree from Allahabad. He had shown his\\nexcellence as a lyricist, singer and music composer .\\nLal Advani, himself visually impaired, established an\\nAssociation for special education and rehabilitation of disabled\\nin India. Besides this, he represented India on Braille problems\\nin UNESCO.\\nHelen A. Keller , an American author and lectur er, is per haps the most well-\\nknown and inspiring visually challenged person. She lost her sight when she was\\nonly 18 months old. But because of her resolve and courage she could complete\\nher graduation from a university. She wrote a number of books including The\\nStory of my Life  (1903).Helen A. KellerVisually impaired people learn the\\nBraille system by beginning with\\nletters,  then special characters and\\nletter combinations. Methods depend\\nupon recognition by touching.

Are there days when\\nthe shape of the moon appears to be\\nperfectly r ound? Ar e ther e days when\\nthe moon cannot be seen at all even if\\nthe sky is clear?\\nThe day on which the whole disc of\\nthe moon is visible is known as the full\\nmoon day. Thereafter, every night the\\nsize of the bright part of the moon\\nappears to become thinner and thinner.\\nOn the fifteenth day the moon is not\\nvisible. This day is known as the ‘new\\nmoon day’. The next day, only a small\\nportion of the moon appears in the sky.\\nThis is known as the crescent moon.\\nThen again the moon grows larger every\\nday.

It is a planet. There\\nare seven other planets that revolve\\naround the Sun.

The time taken by a\\nplanet to complete one revolution is\\ncalled its period of revolution. The period\\nof revolution increases as the distance\\nof the planet increases from the su n.Besides revolving around the Sun, a\\nplanet also rotates on its own axis like a\\ntop (Fig. 17.19).

One of the\\nmost well known astronomers is\\nAryabhata. The work of Aryabhata on\\nastronomy can be found in his\\nwriting ‘ Aryabhatiya\\n’. He wrote it in\\n499 CE at the age of 23 years. The\\ndiameter of the Earth as stated by\\nAryabhata is close to its presently\\nknown value. Disregarding the\\npopular view that Earth is ‘ achala ’\\n(immovable), Aryabhata stated that\\nEarth is sphere and rotates on its own\\naxis. His estimate about the sidereal\\nperiod of Earth was 23 hours, 56\\nminutes and 4.1 seconds, which is\\nvery close to the presently known\\nvalue. He also correctly stated that\\nthe moon and the planets shine due\\nto reflected sunlight. He also gave a\\nscientific explanation for solar and\\nlunar eclipses. When the shadow ofthe Earth falls on the\\nmoon, it causes lunar\\neclipse. When the\\nshadow of the moon\\nfalls on the Earth, it\\ncauses solar eclipse.\\nAryabhata also found\\nthe distance between\\nthe Earth and the\\nmoon, which is very\\nclose to the known\\nvalue today.\\nMercury (Budh)\\nThe planet mercury is nearest to the\\nSun. It is the smallest planet of our\\nsolar system. Because Mercury is very\\nclose to the Sun, it is very difficult to\\nobserve it, as most of the time it is\\nhidden in the glare of the Sun.\\nHowever, it can be observed just before\\nsunrise or just after sunset, near the\\nhorizon. So it is visible only at places\\nwhere trees or buildings do not obstruct\\nthe view of the horizon.

Sometimes\\nit appears in the western sky just after\\nsunset. Therefore it is often called a\\nmorning or an evening star, although it\\nis not a star.

The length of the tail grows in size\\nas it approaches the sun. The tail of a\\ncomet is always directed away from the\\nsun (Fig. 17.26).\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 232Fig. 17.26 :  Different position of a Comet\\nMany comets are known to appear\\nperiodically.

Can\\nyou tell, when Halley’s comet will be\\nvisible again?\\nSuperstitions about the Comets\\nSome people think that comets are\\nmessengers of disasters, such as\\nwars, epidemics and floods. But these\\nare all myths and superstitions.\\nAppearance of a comet is a natural\\nphenomenon. We have no reason to\\nbe afraid of it.\\nMeteors and Meteorites\\nAt night, when the sky is clear and the\\nmoon is not there, you may sometimes\\nsee bright streaks of light in the sky (Fig.\\n17.27). These are commonly known as\\nshooting stars, although they are not\\nstars. They are called meteors . A meteor\\nis usually a small object that\\noccasionally enters the earth’s\\natmosphere. At that time it has a very\\nhigh speed. The friction due to the\\natmosphere heats it up. It glows and\\nevaporates quickly. That is why the\\nbright steak lasts for a very short time.Fig. 17.27 :  Streak of a Meteor\\nSome meteors are large and so they\\ncan reach the Earth before they\\nevaporate completely. The body that\\nreaches the Earth is called a meteorite .\\nMeteorites help scientists in\\ninvestigating the nature of the material\\nfrom which the solar system was formed.\\nMeteor Showers\\nWhen the Earth crosses the tail of a\\ncomet, swarms of meteors are seen.\\nThese are known as meteor showers.\\nSome meteor showers occur at\\nregular intervals each year. You can\\nfind the time of their appearance from\\na scientific magazine or from the\\ninternet.\\nArtificial Satellites\\nYou must have heard that there are a\\nnumber of artificial satellites which are\\norbiting the Earth. You might wonder\\nhow artificial satellites are different from\\nnatural satellites. Artificial satellites are\\nman-made. They are launched from the\\nEarth.

The Sun is now said to be in uttarayan\\n(moving north). Fr om the equator , only on two days, on the days of\\nthe \\nequinoxes  (around 21 March and 23 September) the Sun rises\\nin the east. On all other days, it rises either north of east or south\\nof east. So, the direction of the rising Sun is not a good guide to\\ndetermine directions. The Pole Star, which defines North, is a much\\nbetter indicator of directions.\\n6.Form a group of students. Prepare a model of the solar system\\nshowing the planets, and their relative sizes.

But they were disappointed\\nto hear that the beauty of this\\nmonument in white marble is being\\nthreatened by air pollution in the area\\nsurrounding the Taj. They were eager\\nto know if something can be done to\\ncontrol the air and water pollution.\\nWe ar e all awar e that our\\nenvironment is not what it used to be.\\nOur elders talk about the clean water\\nand fresh air that was available in their\\ntimes. Now the media regularly reports\\non the falling quality of the environment.\\nWe ourselves feel the impact of the falling\\nquality of air and water in our lives. The\\nnumber of people suffering from diseases\\nof the respiratory system, for example,\\nis steadily rising.\\nWe shudder to imagine a time when\\nclean air and water may no longer be\\navailable! Y ou have lear nt about the\\nimportance of air and water in your\\npr\\nevious classes. In this chapter , we will\\nstudy about the harmful changes taking\\nplace in our surroundings and their\\neffects on our lives.\\n18.1 Air Pollution\\nWe can survive for some time without food,\\nbut we cannot survive even for a few\\nminutes without air . This simple fact tells\\nus how important clean air is to us.You alr eady know that air consists\\nof a mixture of gases. By volume, about\\n78% of this mixture is nitrogen and\\nabout 21% is oxygen. Carbon dioxide,\\nargon, methane, ozone and water\\nvapour are also present in very small\\nquantities.\\nActivity 18.1\\nYou may have cover ed your nose\\nwhile passing a brick kiln emitting\\nsmoke or started coughing while\\nwalking on a busy road (Fig. 18.1).\\nOn the basis of your experience,\\ncompare the quality of air at the\\nplaces given below:\\n/circle6A park and a busy road.\\n/circle6A residential area and an\\nindustrial area.\\n/circle6A busy traffic  intersection at\\ndifferent times of the day e.g.\\nearly morning, afternoon and\\nevening.\\n/circle6A village and a town.\\nFig. 18.1 :  A congested road in a city\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 240\\nFig. 18.3 :  Air pollution due to automobilesOne of your observations in the\\nabove activity could be the differences\\nin the amount of smoke in the\\natmosphere. Do you know where the\\nsmoke could have come from? Addition\\nof such substances to the atmosphere\\nmodifies it. When air is contaminated\\nby  unwanted substances which have\\na harmful effect on both the living and\\nthe non-living, it is referred to as air\\npollution .\\n18.2 How does Air Get Polluted?\\nThe substances which contaminate the\\nair are called air pollutants . Sometimes,\\nsuch substances may come from natural\\nsources like smoke and dust arising from\\nforest fires or volcanic eruptions.\\nPollutants are also added to the\\natmosphere by certain human activities.\\nThe sources of air pollutants are\\nfactories (Fig. 18.2), power plants,\\nautomobile exhausts and burning of\\nfirewood and dung cakes.Activity 18.2\\nYou might have r ead in the\\nnewspapers that respiratory\\nproblems amongst children\\nare rising day by day. Conduct a\\nsurvey of households in your\\nneighbourhood and among friends\\nto find out how many children are\\nsuffering from respiratory problems.\\nMany respiratory problems are\\ncaused by air pollution. Let us now try\\nto find out the substances or pollutants\\nwhich ar e present in the polluted air .\\nHave you noticed how rapidly the\\nnumber of vehicles is increasing in our\\ncities?\\nVehicles pr oduce high levels of\\npollutants like carbon monoxide, carbon\\ndioxide, nitrogen oxides and smoke (Fig.\\n18.3). Carbon monoxide is produced\\nfrom incomplete burning of fuels such\\nas petrol and diesel. It is a poisonous\\ngas. It reduces the oxygen-carrying\\ncapacity of the blood.\\nFig. 18.2 :  Smoke from a factoryDo you know?\\nIf the vehicles registered in Delhi are\\nlined up one after the other , the total\\nlength would be nearly equal to the\\ncombined lengths of the two longest\\nrivers in the world, Nile and Amazon!\\n2018-19\\nPOLLUTION  OF AIR AND WATER 241\\nBoojho  remembers  seeing a thick\\nfog-like layer in the atmosphere,\\nespecially during winters. This is smog\\nwhich is made up of smoke and fog.\\nSmoke may contain oxides of nitrogen\\nwhich combine with other air pollutants\\nand fog to form smog. The smog causes\\nbreathing difficulties such as asthma,\\ncough and wheezing in children.\\nMany industries are also responsible\\nfor causing air pollution. Petroleum\\nrefineries are a major source of gaseous\\npollutants like sulphur dioxide and\\nnitrogen dioxide. Sulphur dioxide is\\nproduced by combustion of fuels like\\ncoal in power plants. It can cause\\nrespiratory problems, including\\npermanent lung damage.  Y ou have\\nalready studied about the burning of\\nfossil fuels in Chapter 5.\\nOther kinds of pollutants are\\nchlorofluorocarbons\\n (CFCs) which are\\nused in refrigerators, air conditioners\\nand aerosol sprays. CFCs damage the\\nozone layer of the atmosphere. Recall\\nthat the ozone layer protects us from\\nharmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. Have\\nyou hear d of the ozone hole? T ry to find\\nout about it. Thankfully, less harmful\\nchemicals are now being used in place\\nof CFCs.\\nIn addition to the above mentioned\\ngases, automobiles which burn diesel\\nand petrol, also produce tiny particles\\nwhich remain suspended in air for long\\nperiods (Fig. 18.3). They reduce\\nvisibility. When inhaled, they cause\\ndiseases. Such particles are also\\nproduced during industrial processes\\nlike steel making and mining. Power\\nplants give out tiny ash particles which\\nalso pollute the atmosphere.Activity 18.3\\nPrepare a table using the pollutants\\nmentioned above. Y ou may even add\\nmore data to the following Table.\\nTable 18.1\\nAir Pollutants Sources Effects\\n18.3 Case Study—\\nThe Taj Mahal\\nOver the past 2 decades, India’s most\\nfamous tourist attraction, Taj Mahal\\nlocated in Agra (Fig. 18.4), has become\\na matter of concern. Experts have\\nwarned that pollutants in air are\\ndiscolouring its white marble. So, it is\\nnot only living organisms that get\\naffected by polluted air but non-living\\nthings like buildings, monuments and\\nstatues also get affected.\\nThe industries located in and around\\nAgra like rubber processing, automobile,\\nchemicals and especially the Mathura oil\\nrefinery, have been responsible for\\nproducing pollutants like sulphur\\ndioxide and nitrogen dioxide. These\\ngases react with the water vapour present\\nin the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid\\nand nitric acid. The acid s drop down with\\nrain, making the rain acidic. This is\\ncalled acid rain. Acid rain corrodes the\\nmarble of the monument. The\\nphenomenon is also called “Marble\\ncancer”. Suspended particulate matter\\n,\\nsuch as the soot particle s emitted by\\nMathura oil refinery, has contributed\\ntowards the yellowing of the marble.\\nThe Supreme Court has taken\\nseveral steps to save the Taj.

If you\\nhave seen a greenhouse in a nursery or\\nelsewhere, recall that the sun’s heat is\\nallowed to get in but is not allowed to\\ngo out. The trapped heat warms the\\ngreen house. The trapping of radiations\\nby the earth’s atmospher e is similar .\\nThat is why it is called the greenhouse\\neffect\\n. Without this process, life would\\nnot have been possible on the earth. But\\nnow it threatens life. Excess of CO2 in\\nthe air is one of the gases responsible\\nfor this effect.\\nYou know that CO2 is one of the\\ncomponents of air . You have also studiedI am reminded of the\\nchapter on crops. I\\nwonder whether acid rain\\naffects the soil and\\nplants also.\\nBut how does CO2 content\\nrise in the atmosphere and\\nbecome excessive?ordered industries to switch to cleaner\\nfuels like CNG (Compressed Natural Gas)\\nand LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas).\\nMoreover , the automobiles should\\nswitch over to unleaded petrol in the Taj\\nzone.\\nDiscuss with your elders and see\\nwhat they have to say about the\\ncondition of the Taj, 20 or 30 years ago!\\nTry to pr ocure a pictur e of the T aj Mahal\\nfor your scrap book.\\n18.4 Greenhouse Effect\\nYou know that the sun’s rays war m the\\nearth’s sur face.

But\\nif ther e is excess of CO2 in the air , it\\nacts as a pollutant.\\nCan you help Paheli find out  the\\nanswer to her question?\\nOn the one hand, CO2 is continuously\\nbeing released because of human\\nactivities. On the other hand, area under\\nforests is decreasing. Plants utili se CO2\\nfrom the atmosphere for photosynthesis,\\nthereby decreasing the amount of CO2\\nin the air . Defor estation leads to an\\nincrease in the amount of CO2 in the air\\nbecause the number of trees which\\nconsume CO2 is reduced. Human\\nactivities, thus, contribute to the\\naccumulation of CO2 in the  atmosphere.\\nCO2 traps heat and does not allow it to\\nescape into space. As a result, the average\\ntemperature of the earth’s atmosphere\\nis gradually increasing. This is called\\nglobal warming .\\nOther gases like methane, nitrous\\noxide and water vapour also contribute\\nGlobal W arming\\nA Serious Threat!\\nGlobal warming can cause sea levels\\nto rise dramatically. In many places,\\ncoastal areas have already been\\nflooded. Global warming could result\\nin wide ranging effects on rainfall\\npatterns, agriculture, forests, plants\\nand animals. Majority of people living\\nin regions which are threatened by\\nglobal warming are in Asia. A recent\\nclimate change report gives us only\\na limited time to keep  the greenhouse\\ngases at the present level. Otherwise,\\nthe temperature may rise by more\\nthan 2 degrees Celsius by the end of\\nthe century, a level considered\\ndangerous.towards this effect. Like CO2, they are\\nalso called greenhouse gases .\\nGlobal warming has become a major\\nconcern for governments worldwide.\\nMany countries have reached an\\nagreement to reduce the emission of\\ngreenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol\\nis one such agreement.\\nBoojho is surprised to hear that an\\nincrease in the earth’s temperature by\\neven as little as 0.5 °C can have such a\\nserious effect!  Paheli tells him that she\\nhad read in the newspapers recently that\\nthe Gangotri glacier in the Himalayas\\nhas started melting because of global\\nwarming.\\n18.5 What can be Done?\\nWhat can we do to reduce air\\npollution?\\nThere are many success stories in our\\nfight against air pollution. For example,\\na few years ago, Delhi was one of the\\nmost polluted cities in the world. It was\\nbeing choked by fumes released from\\nautomobiles running on diesel and\\npetrol. A decision was taken to switch\\nto fuels like CNG (Fig. 18.5) and\\nFig. 18.5 :  A  public transport bus powered by CNG\\n2018-19\\nSCIENCE 244unleaded petrol. These measures have\\nresulted in cleaner air for the city. Y ou\\nmight know of some other examples\\nfrom your area regarding reduction of\\nair pollution.

However , recently a study by\\nthe W orld W ide Fund for Natur e (WWF)\\nfound that Ganga is one of the ten most\\nendangered rivers in the world. The\\npollution levels have been rising for\\nmany years. W e have reached this stage\\nbecause the towns and cities, through\\nwhich the river flows, throw large\\nquantities of garbage, untreated sewage,\\ndead bodies, and many other harmful\\nthings, dir ectly into the river . In fact the\\nriver is ‘dead’  at many places where the\\npollution levels are so high that aquatic\\nlife cannot survive.\\nAn ambitious plan to save the river ,\\ncalled the Ganga Action Plan  was\\nlaunched in 1985. It aimed to reduce\\nthe pollution levels in the river . However ,\\nthe increasing population and\\nindustrialisation have already damaged\\nthis mighty river beyond r epair. Now, the\\nGovernment of India has launched a new\\ninitiative known as National Mission for\\nClean Ganga (NMCG) in 2016.\\nLet us take a specific example to\\nunderstand the situation. The Ganga\\nat Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh (U.P .), has\\none of the most polluted stretches of\\nthe river (Fig. 18.8). Kanpur is one of\\nthe most populated towns in U.P .People can be seen bathing, washing\\nclothes and defecating in the river .\\nThey also throw garbage, flowers,\\nidols of gods and god desses and non-\\nbiodegradable polythene bags into the\\nriver.\\nAt Kanpur the amount of water is\\ncomparatively small and the flow of the\\nriver is very slow. In addition, Kanpur\\nhas more than 5000 industries. These\\ninclude fertiliser , deter gent, leather and\\npaint industries. These industrial units\\ndischarge toxic chemical wastes into the\\nriver.\\nBased on the above information\\nthink of the answers to the following\\nquestions –\\n/circle6What are the factors responsible for\\npollution of the river ?\\n/circle6What steps can be taken to restore\\nthe river Ganga to its past glory ?\\n/circle6How would the disposal of garbage,\\netc., affect the living organisms in the\\nriver ?\\nMany industries discharge harmful\\nchemicals into rivers and streams,\\ncausing the pollution of water\\n(Fig. 18.9).

These industries\\ncause chemical contamination of water .\\nThe chemicals released include  arsenic,\\nlead and fluorides which lead to toxicity\\nin plants and animals.  There are\\nregulations to prevent this. Industries\\nare supposed to treat the waste\\nproduced before discharging it into\\nwaters, but quite often the rules are not\\nfollowed. The soil is also affected by\\nimpur e water\\n, causing changes in\\nacidity, growth of worms, etc.\\nWe have lear nt in Chapter 1 the\\nimportance of pesticides and weedicides\\nfor the pr otection of cr ops. However , all\\nthese chemicals dissolve in water and\\nare washed into water bodies from the\\nfields. They also seep into the ground\\nto pollute ground water .\\nHave you seen ponds which look\\ngreen from a distance because they have\\na lot of algae growing in them? This is\\ncaused by excessive quantities of\\nchemicals which get washed from the\\nfields. These act as nutrients for algae\\nto flourish. Once these algae die, they\\nserve as food for decomposers like\\nbacteria. A lot of oxygen in the water\\nbody gets used up. This results in a\\ndecrease in the oxygen level which may\\nkill aquatic organisms.\\nRecall Activity 18.6\\nYou had investigated the sewage\\ndisposal system of your locality in\\nClass VII.\\nDo you remember how the\\nsewage was collected from your\\nhome and where it went thereafter?\\nSometimes untreated sewage is\\nthrown directly into rivers. It containsfood wastes, deter gents, micr oor-\\nganisms, etc. Can ground water get\\npolluted by sewage? How?  W ater\\ncontaminated with sewage may contain\\nbacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites\\nwhich cause diseases like cholera,\\ntyphoid and jaundice.\\nThe bacteria present in the faeces\\nof mammals are indicators of the\\nquality of water . If water has these\\nbacteria, it means that it has been\\ncontaminated by fecal matter . If such\\nwater is used by us, it can cause various\\ninfections.\\nDo you know?\\nHot water can also be a pollutant !\\nThis is usually water from power\\nplants and industries.

What are the actions that can be grouped as a push or a pull and what do you need to do to make it easier for you to identify them? To move an object it has to be pushed or pulled in science a push or a pull on an object is called a force when does a force come into play let us find out 201819 force and pressure 129fig 113 b who is pulling whom 112 forces are due to an interaction suppose a man is standing behind a stationary car fig112a will the car move due to his presence suppose the man now begins to push the car fig112b The net force on an object is zero if the two forces acting on it in opposite directions are equal rope in their direction sometimes the rope simply does not move. How much force do you need to pull a rope with to move a heavy object like a table or a box fig114a is it easier to move it now can you explain why now push it from the opposite side fig114b does the object move if it does note the direction in which it moves 115 the rope may not move if the two teams pull at it with equal force fig 115 members of both the teams try to pull the 2018 In this lesson we are going to find out what happens when a force acts on an object activity we are going to find out what happens when a force acts on an object activity we are going to find out what happens when a force acts on an object activity we are going to find out what happens when a force acts on an object activity we are going to find out what happens when a force acts on an object activity we are going to find The speed of a moving ball can change if the force applied by the player on the ball is in the direction of its motion the speed of the object increases if the force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion the speed of the object decreases if the force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion the speed of the object increases if the force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion the speed of A force can be used to change the speed of an object or its direction of motion by pushing it along a level surface or by placing a ruler in its pathastate of motion a force can be used to change the direction of motion of an object by pushing it along a level surface or by placing a ruler in its pathastate of motion a force can be used to change the direction of motion of an object by pushing it along a Force can change the shape of an object when it is applied to it in a way that it moves in a state of motion that is different from the state it was in before the force was applied. table 201819 science 134 fig119 muscular force of animals is used to carry out many difficult tasks note your observations in columns 4 and 5 of the table 201819 science 134 fig119 muscular force of animals is used to carry out many difficult tasks What are the effects of a force on an object and how do we know what is happening when a force is applied to an object or its shape? In class we have been learning about the force that is exerted by the muscles in our body we have been learning about the force that is exerted by the muscles in our body we have been learning about the force that is exerted by the muscles in our body we have been learning about the force that is exerted by the muscles in our body we have been learning about the force that is exerted by the muscles in our body we have been learning about the If you have ever been in a situation where a moving object comes to a stop it is a good idea to know what causes it to come to a stop. The force exerted on an object when it is in contact with another object is known as the contact force and it is important to understand how this force works. The force exerted on a body when it is not in contact with another charged body is known as noncontact for ce you will learn more about electric charges in chapter 15 gravitational force you know that a coin or a pen falls to the ground when it slips off your hand l eaves and fruits also fall to the ground when they get detached from the plant have you ever wondered why it is so when the coin is held in your hand it is at The force exerted by a magnet on a piece of iron is an example of a noncontact force electrostatic force activity 117 take a plastic straw and cut it into nearly two equal pieces now hold the other piece of straw in your hand and rub its free end with a sheet of paper bring the rubbed end of the straw near the suspended straw make sure that the two pieces do not touch each other The force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects In class we have been learning about the difference in pressure and force between the earth and the air we have been learning about the difference in air pressure between the earth and the air we have been learning about the difference in air pressure between the earth and the air we have been learning about the difference in air pressure between the earth and the air we have been learning about the difference in air pressure between the earth and the air we have been learning about What is the pressure exerted by liquids and gases when they are cut and pierced or when they are held in place by a rubber balloon fig1114 what is the pressure exerted by liquids and gases when they are held in place by a rubber balloon fig1114 what is the pressure exerted by liquids and gases when they are held in place by a rubber balloon fig1114 what is the pressure exerted by liquids and gases when they are held in place What do you observe when you take a plastic bottle y ou can take a discarded water or soft drink bottle y ou can do so by slightly heating one end of the glass tube and then quickly inserting it near the bottom of the bottle make sure that the water does not leak from the joint if there is any leakage seal it with molten wax cover the mouth of the glass tube as you did in activity 118 now fill the bottle half with water and The pressure exerted by water on the walls of the pipes when you inflate a balloon is not due to the pressure exerted by water on the walls of the pipes when you fill a bottle with water what do you observe when you drill four holes all around near the bottom of the bottle 1116 now fill the bottle with water what do you observe when you drill four holes all around near the bottom of the bottle 1116 now fill the bottle with water We know that air exerts pressure in all directions we know that pressure is force per unit area 1117 fig1118 a rubber sucker pressed on a surface when you pr ess the sucker most of the air between its cup and the sur face escapes out the sucker sticks to the surface because the pr essur e of atmosphere acts on it to pull the sucker off the sur face the applied for ce should be large enough to overcome the The pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric pressure and balances the pressure from outside did you know otto von guericke a german scientist of the 17th century invented a pump to extract air out of a vessel with the help of this pump he demonstrated dramatically the force of the air pressure he joined two hollow metallic hemispheres of 51 cm diameter each and pumped air out of them she then released the arrow which begins to move The following situations identify the agent exerting the force and the object on which it acts state the effect of the force in each case asqueezing a piece of lemon between the fingers to extract its juice In our series of letters from African journalists we take a look at some of the most read letters from African journalists over the past five years, as compiled by the BBC In this lesson you will learn how to measure the pressure exerted by a stool on a sand bed and how to fill a tumbler with water to test the pressure exerted by a stool on a sand bed. In this video I will show you how to pour water into a tumbler using a plastic card and a bottle of different shapes and sizes you will find that the card continues to hold water in the tumbler even after it is not supported by your hand you will find that the card continues to hold water in the tumbler even after it is not supported by your hand you will find that the card continues to hold water in the tumbler even after it is not The force of friction between the surfaces of a book and a table is always opposed to the applied force in the above activity the force of friction always opposes the applied force in the above activity the force of friction always opposes the applied force in the above activity the force of friction always opposes the applied force in the above activity the force of friction always opposes the applied force in the above activity the force of friction always opposes the applied force in the above In this lesson we are going to use spring balance to measure the force acting on an object it is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object it is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object it is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object it is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object it is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object it is a device used The distance covered by a pencil cell depends on the surface on which the cell moves and the smoothness of the sur face on which the cell moves.

How much friction do you need to have between two surfaces to cause them to move in a given direction and how much friction do you need to have between the surfaces to cause them to roll in a given direction and how much friction do you need to have between the surfaces to cause them to slide in a given direction and how much friction do you need to have between the surfaces to cause them to roll in a given direction and how much friction do Children have been learning about frictional forces on a variety of surfaces from a marble floor to a book on a board and even a toy car. What do you think are the most important things to know about friction in science and how can we use them to our advantage in our daily lives? How do you come to know that a period is over in your school you come to know easily that someone is at your door when he knocks or you hear the sound of the doorbell most of the time you make out that What are the sounds we hear in our surroundings and how does it help us to communicate with one another we hear a variety of sounds in our surroundings and how does it help us to communicate with one another we hear a variety of sounds in our surroundings and how does it help us to communicate with one another we hear a variety of sounds in our surroundings and how does it help us to communicate with one another we hear a variety of sounds in our What do you see when you look at a vibrating object or part of a vibrating part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a Table 135 ektara manjira 201819 science 160 132 musical instruments ghatam make a list of familiar musical instruments and identify their vibrating parts a few examples are given in table 131 complete rest of the tablefig 135 ektara manjira 201819 science 160 132 sound produced by humans speak loudly for a while or sing a song or buzz like a bee do you feel any vibrations in humans the sound is produced by the voice box or The sound of a mridangam is the sound of the whole instrument being forced to vibrate the sound of a mridangam is the sound of the whole instrument being forced to vibrate the sound of a mridangam is the sound of the whole instrument being forced to vibrate the sound of a mridangam is the sound of the whole instrument being forced to vibrate the sound of a mridangam is the sound of the whole instrument being forced In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at some of the most common questions about sound. How do you hear sound when you suck air out of a tumbler you can hear the sound when you suck all the air in the tumbler you can hear the sound when you suck all the air in the tumbler you can hear the sound when you suck all the air in the tumbler you can hear the sound when you suck all the air in the tumbler you can hear the sound when you s This week we are looking at sound we are going to be looking at how sound travels through solids we are going to be looking at how sound travels through the eardrum we are going to be looking at how sound travels through strings we are going to be looking at how sound travels through strings we are going to be looking at how sound travels through strings we are going to be looking at how sound travels through strings we are going to be looking at how In our series of letters from British journalists we take a look at some of the more unusual sounds we have come to know and associate with British culture. The sound of a ball hitting a vibrating glass tumbler is produced by the vibration of the tumbler and the sound produced by hitting the tumbler is proportional to the amplitude of the vibration producing the sound. What is the loudness of a sound and what is the pitch of a sound and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and The frequency of the sound of a bird is higher than that of an adult usually the voice of a child has a higher frequency than that of a man 136 audible sounds we know that we need a vibrating body for the production of sound can we hear the sound of all vibrating bodies the fact is that sounds of less than about 20 vibrations per second 20 hz cannot be detected by the human ear thus for human ear the range of audible frequencies is How do you know if the sound you are making is pleasing to the ear or is it harmful to your hearing and how do you tell if it is harmful?

In our series of letters from African journalists we are looking at some of the more unusual uses of gold and silver in everyday life and how you can make your own. A young girl named paheli has been experimenting with a method of making electroplated objects by adding a solution of copper and sulphite to a solution of water. In our series of letters from African journalists we look at one of the most common methods of coating metal objects with a thin layer of a different metal fig148 the layer of metal deposited has some desired property which the metal of the object lacks for example iron tends to corr ode and rust so a coating of zinc is deposited on iron to protect it from corrosion and formation of rust boojho could get only one copper plate so he performed activity Here is a selection of some of the more interesting electrical engineering questions that have been asked over the years by the BBC's science and technology correspondents. In this week's science lesson we take a look at some of the more unusual objects that you may have come across in your daily life. In this week's lesson we are going to look at the process of electroplated objects and we are going to take a look at the meaning of entrepreneur In this chapter you will learn how to make a fun pen for yourself and how to protect yourself from destructive natural phenomena such as lightning and earthquakes. In our series of letters from African journalists we take a look at some of the reasons why some people are afraid of lightning and why it is so dangerous. In our series of letters from African journalists we take a look at some of the more unusual things you might have seen or heard in your life.

This is a demonstration of a device that can be used to test whether an object is charged or not, it can be used to test whether a body is charged or not, it can be used to test whether a body is charged or not, it can be used to test whether a body is charged or not, it can be used to test whether a body is charged or not, it can be used to test whether a body is charged In this lesson you will find out how to transfer electrical charge from a charged object to another charged object by touching a paper clip with your hand. Lightning strikes occur when two or more clouds or between clouds and the earth strike at the same time and produce electric charges in the air or water. As part of our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at 156 lightning safety during lightning and thunderstorm. The safest position to be in during a lightning strike is in the centre of the room where you will be most likely to be hit the safest place to be during a lightning strike is in the back of the room where you will be most likely to be hit the safest place to be during a lightning strike is in the front of the room where you will be most likely to be hit the safest place to be during a lightning strike is in the Earthquakes can be caused by a number of factors including but not limited to the movement of the earth, the movement of rocks, the movement of water and the movement of air. An earthquake is an event which takes place on the earth's surface and can cause immense damage to buildings bridges dams and landslides and tsunamis. Earthquakes have been a part of our lives for thousands of years but until recently people did not know that earthquakes were caused by the movement of earth splates. There have been a number of earthquakes in India in the past few years with the most recent being a magnitude 6.9 earthquake which struck in the north-west of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Earthquakes are one of the most dangerous natural phenomena in the world they can cause serious damage to buildings and infrastructure and can be very destructive to lives and property. In the event of an earthquake the best way to protect yourself and your home is to build a structure that is quakeresistant it is better to build a structure that is high enough to withstand an earthquake than to build a structure that is low enough to withstand an earthquake. Earthquakes are the most common type of natural disaster in the world but they can be very dangerous if you are near one and you are struck by lightning. Earthquakes can cause severe damage to life and property we should take necessary precautions to protect ourselves from earthquakes 201819 some natural phenomena 197 natural phenomena select the correct option in questions 1 and 2 1 How much charge do we have in our bodies when we walk, run, swim, cycle, run on a treadmill, run on a stationary bike, run on a treadmill, run on a stationary bike, run on a treadmill, run on a stationary bike, run on a treadmill, run on a stationary bike, run on a stationary bike, run on a stationary bike, run on a stationary bike, run on a stationary bike, run What do you think is the most important thing that you can do to protect yourself in the event that there is an earthquake in your area 10 tell me what is the most important thing that you can do to protect yourself in the event that there is an earthquake in your area 11 tell me what is the most important thing that you can do to protect yourself in the event that there is an earthquake in your area 12 tell me what is the most A look at some of the papers that have been submitted for this year's National Eisteddfod in Eisteddfod, Germany. In class we have been learning about reflection we have been looking at the laws of reflection and how they can be applied to our daily lives we have been looking at the laws of reflection and how they can be applied to objects we have been looking at the laws of reflection and how they can be applied to objects we have been looking at the laws of reflection and how they can be applied to objects we have been looking at the laws of reflection and The angle of reflection and the angle of incidence are two of the most important laws of physics we will look at the angle of reflection and the angle of incidence in more detail later on. ray streaking is a method of measuring the reflection of light on a surface by using a torch as the source of light and a mirror as the source of light. An image of an object in front of a plane mirror is an image of the object in front of the mirror with features of the same size as the object in front of it. In class vii we have been learning about the laws of reflection we have been doing some activities outside the classroom and here is what we have been doing: In this lesson we will look at the laws of reflection and how they can be used to see objects which are not visible directly from a periscope. A plane mirror is a piece of equipment used to transfer light from one part of the earth to another the reflected light travels from one part of the earth to another and vice versa. To make a kaleidoscope use two mirrors placed at an angle to one another in a circular tube or tube of a thick chart paper fix this arrangement of mirrors in a circular cardboard tube or tube of a thick chart paper make sur e that the tube is slightly longer than the mirror strips 1612 making a kaleidoscope 201819 light 205disc place on this glass plate several small pieces of coloured glass broken pieces of coloured bangles close this end of the tube by kaleidoscopes are one of the most popular children's toys and can be used in a number of different ways you can make one for yourself or buy one from a shop. How can you explain the reflection of light from a mirror on a wall if the wall is not white fix a sheet of white paper on it reflected light will be seen to have many colours how can you explain the reflection of light from a mirror on a wall if the wall is not white fix a sheet of white paper on it reflected light will be seen to have many colours how can you explain the reflection of light from a mirror on a wall The eye is made up of two parts the retina which is the part of the eye that detects light and the choroid which is the part of the eye that sense colour. The eye is one of the most important parts of the body and is responsible for seeing the world around us the retina is the part of the eye which is responsible for seeing the world around us the macula is the part of the eye which is responsible for seeing the world around us the choroid is the part of the eye which is responsible for seeing the world around us the iris is the part of the eye which is responsible for seeing the world Eye problems can be caused by a number of things but the most common of them is cataract which is a defect in the lens of the eye. Watch this video to see how to make a bird cage from a piece of cardboard and to learn more about eye problems and how to prevent them. The eyes of a bird can see well in the dark but not during the day the night bird owl has a large cornea and a large pupil to allow more light in its eye but not in the night the kite eagle has a large cornea and a large pupil to allow more light in its eye but not in the night the night bird owl has a large cornea and a large pupil to allow more light in its eye but not in the night the A visually challenged person is a person who has lost one or more of their senses and cannot read or write with the aid of their other senses. Braille is one of the most widely used aids for the blind and visually impaired in the world and is widely used in India as well as other parts of the world. India is one of the few countries in the world where visually impaired people are not only allowed to attend university but are also given special education and rehabilitation. braille is a system of writing which is used by visually impaired people to communicate with the rest of the world by writing on paper with a pen or pencil. Here is a guide to some of the most important facts about the eye and how they affect our perception of the world around us and how we can improve our ability to see.

In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at some of the top stories of the week. The moon is the brightest object in the night sky in our ancestors per acient observations of sky their knowledge of astronomy was highly advanced for their time passed stars moon planets in the sky helped them to devise almanacs and a better understanding of climate and rainfall patterns for timely sowing and choice of crops fixing the dates of seasons and festivals let us also make some observations of celestial objects and learn about them There are 172 phases of the moon in our solar system the moon plays an important role in our social life almost all festivals in our social life are celebrated according to the 172 phases of the moon The moon is one of the seven planets in the solar system and its orbit around the earth is made up of a series of small wobbles in the earth's surface called phases. Have a look at these positions in your notebook in which part of the sky would you look for the full moon the size of the illuminated part of the moon visible from the earth increases each day after the new moon day after the full moon day In our series of letters from African journalists we take a look at some of the stories behind some of the most famous images from the African continent. The moon is the nearest star to the earth and the closest object to the earth that you can see in the night sky 178 the distance between the earth and the moon is about 40 million km The distance between the earth and the sun is known as the distance from the sun to the earth and the distance from the earth to the sun is known as the distance from the sun to the earth and the distance from the earth to the sun is known as the distance from the sun to the earth and the distance from the earth to the sun is known as the distance from the sun to the earth and the distance from the earth to the sun Have you ever wondered why the stars appear to move in the sky when the earth is moving from one side to the other on its axis 201819 stars and the solar system 221? Here is a list of some of the most famous constellations which you can see duringactivity 175 take an umbrella and open it make about 1015 stars out of white paper 179 now rotate the umbrella by holding its central rod in your hand observe the stars on the umbrella 1711 some constellations in the night sky ursa major saptarshi saptarshi has been associated with seven well known ancient indian sages or rishis as shown in the ursa major is one of the most prominent constellations in the night sky it is visible from most parts of the world this constellation is also known as the big dipper the great bear or the saptarshi there are seven prominent stars in this constellation it appears like a big ladle or a question mark 1712 in all ancient cultures ursa major is one of the most spectacular constellations in the night sky the four bright stars represent the belt of the hunter the three middle stars represent the belt of the hunter the four bright stars appear to be arranged in the form of a quadrilateral the star sirius The constellation orion is one of the most prominent in the night sky it is visible during winter in the early part of the night e sky is located close to orion to locate sirius imagine a straight line passing through the three middle stars of orion look along this line towards the east this line will lead you to a very bright star 1716cassiopeia The solar system is made up of two major planets the sun and the planets that revolve around it the eight planets in their order of distance from the sun are mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus and neptune figure 1717 Astronomy is a branch of science that deals with the study of space and the Earth the sun and its planets are the focus of this week's episode of the BBC's astronomy programme.

The children in your class were fascinated by the Taj Mahal and the fact that it was built on the site of the ancient temple of Karnak. Air is one of the most important substances in our body and it is very important for us to have clean air to breathe and to live a healthy life. Air pollution is a condition in which certain substances or pollutants are added to the atmosphere to make it warmer or cooler than it is at the moment. Air pollution is one of the leading causes of death in the world and is a major public health problem in many parts of the world air pollution is a major cause of death in the world and is a major public health problem in many parts of the world air pollution is a major cause of death in the world and is a major public health problem in many parts of the world air pollution is a major cause of death in the world and is a Air pollution is one of the leading causes of death in the world and it is a major problem in the developing world as well as in the developed world. The Supreme Court has taken several steps to save the taj it has 201819 science 242and a part is reflected back as experts warn that pollutants in air are discolouring its white marble so it is not only living organisms that get affected by polluted air but nonliving things like buildings monuments and statues and also get affected the industries located in and around agra like rubber processing automobile chemicals and especially the mathura oil refinery have been responsible for The earth is warmer than it has been for thousands of years because the reflected radiation from the sun is warmer than the reflected radiation from the earth. In our series of letters from our readers, paheli asks a question about the greenhouse effect and how humans are contributing to global warming by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Global warming is a phenomenon in which the temperature of the earth increases due to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. In our series of letters from school children, we look at some of the ways in which you and your classmates can make a difference to the environment. In our series of letters from African journalists we look at some of the pollution issues faced by students at the University of South Africa in Cape Town. The river ganga is one of the ten most endangered rivers in the world the pollution levels have been rising for many years and the towns and cities through which the river flows throw large The Ganges river is one of the most important rivers in the country it is a major source of drinking water for millions of people in the country it is also a major source of waste water for millions of people in the country it is a major source of drinking water for millions of people in the country it is a major source of waste water for millions of people in the country it is a major source of drinking water for millions of people in the In our series of letters from African journalists, filmmaker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at the pollution of the river ganga in South Africa.

In our series of letters from African journalists, filmmaker and columnist Farai Sevenzo takes a look at some of the most common water-related questions. In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at some of the questions children have about water. Water is one of the most important natural resources in the world but it is also one of the most polluted it is the main source of drinking water for more than half of the world s population. Water is one of the most important natural resources in the world but how do we ensure that it is safe to drink and that it is clean? The BBC News website has a number of resources to help you learn more about air and water pollution - here is a list of some of them: In this lesson you will learn about pollution and how it affects the environment and how you can make a difference to it by doing some of the following: Do you think global warming is a problem and should be tackled by the world's leaders and not just by the people who live in it?\n"

In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at the importance of protected forests in the country. tigers are one of the most endangered big cats in the world they are found in all over the world but in India they are found only in satpura t iger reserve a national park in the state of satpura in the north-east of the country tigers are found in all over the world but in India they are found only in satpura t iger reserve a national park in the state of satpura in the north- satpura t iger reserve is a national park in the state of satpura in the country's north-east which is home to tigers. As part of our series on endangered animals and plants we are looking at the role of small animals in the ecosystem and how they can be saved. A group of school children have been taken on a field trip to a protected forest in the north west of the country to learn more about the causes of deforestation. In our series of letters from African journalists we look at some of the ways in which students at the University of Nairobi are helping to save the world from deforestation. A group of school children are taken on a tour of a forest by a professor ahmad from the department of forest and environment at the university. National parks are important places to visit in India but how do you find out about them and how can you save them from poachers and illegal loggers?

Here is a list of lessons you can take from the BBC News website to help you learn more about reproduction in animals and how it affects our health: reproduction takes place in animals 91 modes of reproduction have you seen the young ones of difent Animals 91 modes of reproduction have you seen the young ones of difent Animals 91 modes of reproduction have you seen the young ones of difent Animals 91 modes of reproduction have you seen the young ones of difent Animals 91 modes of reproduction have you seen the young ones of difent Animals 91 modes of reproduction have you seen the young ones of difent In class 102boojho we have been looking at the reproduction process in animals can you name the different parts of the reproductive system in animals? fertilisation is the process by which a new individual is born from an egg that has been fertilised by a sperm and an ovum. fertili sation takes place outside the body of the female in these animals fertili sation takes place in water 97 eggs of frogfemale lays hundreds of eggs unlike hen s egg frog s egg is not covered by a shell 97 you will be surprised to know that in many animals fertili sation takes place outside the body of the female in these animals fertili sation takes place in Toads lay hundreds of eggs and release millions of sperms all the eggs do not get fertilised and develop into new individuals this is b In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at some of the ways in which animals reproduce. In our series of letters from African journalists we take a look at some of the most common questions you might have about eggs and how they work. The life cycle of an animal begins with the laying of an egg the first stage of an animal's life is the development of an embryo the first stage of an animal's life is the development of an embryo the first stage of an animal's life is the development of an egg the first stage of an animal's life is the development of an embryo the first stage of an animal's life is the development of an egg In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at some of the most popular stories of the week. One of the more unusual forms of cloning is that of the dolly clone of a blackface ewe which is a type of amoeba. dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from a blackface ewe and produced several offspring of her own through normal sexual means she died on 6th fertilisation due to a certain lung disease.

The average height of boys and girls with age the figures in columns 2 and 3 give the percentage of the height a person has reached at the age given in column 1 for example by the age 11 a boy has reached 81 of his probable full height while a girl has reached 88 of her full height The height of an adolescent is determined by the amount of time they spend in the womb as well as the amount of time they spend growing up the height of an adolescent is determined by the amount of time they spend in the womb as well as the amount of time they spend growing up the height of an adolescent is determined by the amount of time they spend growing up the height of an adolescent is determined by the amount of time they spend growing up In this lesson we are going to look at the body shape and voice changes that occur in boys as they enter the age of puberty we are going to look at the body shape and voice changes that occur in boys as they enter the age of puberty we are going to look at the body shape and voice changes that occur in boys as they enter the age of puberty we are going to look at the body shape and voice changes that occur in boys adolescence is a period of change in a person s way of thinking and it is often the time in one s life when the brain has the greatest capacity for learning sometimes however an adolescent may feel insecu In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at the changes puberty can cause in the body. puberty marks the beginning of the reproductive period when one becomes capable of reproduction but they want to know if reproductive life once begun continues or it ends some time puberty is a phase of life in humans that begins when a child reaches the age of 10 or 11 years of age and ends when a child reaches the age of 15 or 16 years of age. The menstrual cycle begins at the age of 14 when the ovaries produce an egg which is fertilised and stored in the ovaries for a period of 12 to 18 months. In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at some of the key facts about the sex of the baby. endocrine glands are found in the human body and are responsible for the production of a number of hormones such as testosterone, insulin, cortisol and many others.

In our series of letters from African journalists, filmmaker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at some of the myths and taboos that adolescents experience. endocrine glands are located in the body and are responsible for the production and regulation of a number of hormones and other chemicals that are important for the body to function properly. What are sex hormones and what do they tell us about our bodies and how do we know we are in the right state to have a baby? Teenage girls are more likely to be overweight than boys and are more likely to be obese, according to a new study by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles. How much do you remember about the sex ratio of men and women in the UK in the 1960s and 1970s and how much do you remember about the sex ratio of women in the 1980s and 1990s and how much do you remember about the sex ratio of men in the 1980s and 1990s and how much do you remember about the sex ratio of women in the 1980s and 1990s and how much do you remember about the In this chapter we are going to look at the state of motion of a ball and how it can be changed to make it move faster or slower. What are the actions that can be grouped as a push or a pull and what do you need to do to make it easier for you to identify them? To move an object it has to be pushed or pulled in science a push or a pull on an object is called a force when does a force come into play let us find out 201819 force and pressure 129fig 113 b who is pulling whom 112 forces are due to an interaction suppose a man is standing behind a stationary car fig112a will the car move due to his presence suppose the man now begins to push the car fig112b The net force on an object is zero if the two forces acting on it in opposite directions are equal rope in their direction sometimes the rope simply does not move. How much force do you need to pull a rope with to move a heavy object like a table or a box fig114a is it easier to move it now can you explain why now push it from the opposite side fig114b does the object move if it does note the direction in which it moves 115 the rope may not move if the two teams pull at it with equal force fig 115 members of both the teams try to pull the 2018 In this lesson we are going to find out what happens when a force acts on an object activity we are going to find out what happens when a force acts on an object activity we are going to find out what happens when a force acts on an object activity we are going to find out what happens when a force acts on an object activity we are going to find out what happens when a force acts on an object activity we are going to find The speed of a moving ball can change if the force applied by the player on the ball is in the direction of its motion the speed of the object increases if the force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion the speed of the object decreases if the force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion the speed of the object increases if the force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion the speed of A force can be used to change the speed of an object or its direction of motion by pushing it along a level surface or by placing a ruler in its pathastate of motion a force can be used to change the direction of motion of an object by pushing it along a level surface or by placing a ruler in its pathastate of motion a force can be used to change the direction of motion of an object by pushing it along a Force can change the shape of an object when it is applied to it in a way that it moves in a state of motion that is different from the state it was in before the force was applied. table 201819 science 134 fig119 muscular force of animals is used to carry out many difficult tasks note your observations in columns 4 and 5 of the table 201819 science 134 fig119 muscular force of animals is used to carry out many difficult tasks What are the effects of a force on an object and how do we know what is happening when a force is applied to an object or its shape?

The force exerted on an object when it is in contact with another object is known as the contact force and it is important to understand how this force works. The force exerted on a body when it is not in contact with another charged body is known as noncontact for ce you will learn more about electric charges in chapter 15 gravitational force you know that a coin or a pen falls to the ground when it slips off your hand l eaves and fruits also fall to the ground when they get detached from the plant have you ever wondered why it is so when the coin is held in your hand it is at The force exerted by a magnet on a piece of iron is an example of a noncontact force electrostatic force activity 117 take a plastic straw and cut it into nearly two equal pieces now hold the other piece of straw in your hand and rub its free end with a sheet of paper bring the rubbed end of the straw near the suspended straw make sure that the two pieces do not touch each other The force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects the force of gravity acts on all objects In class we have been learning about the difference in pressure and force between the earth and the air we have been learning about the difference in air pressure between the earth and the air we have been learning about the difference in air pressure between the earth and the air we have been learning about the difference in air pressure between the earth and the air we have been learning about the difference in air pressure between the earth and the air we have been learning about What is the pressure exerted by liquids and gases when they are cut and pierced or when they are held in place by a rubber balloon fig1114 what is the pressure exerted by liquids and gases when they are held in place by a rubber balloon fig1114 what is the pressure exerted by liquids and gases when they are held in place by a rubber balloon fig1114 what is the pressure exerted by liquids and gases when they are held in place What do you observe when you take a plastic bottle y ou can take a discarded water or soft drink bottle y ou can do so by slightly heating one end of the glass tube and then quickly inserting it near the bottom of the bottle make sure that the water does not leak from the joint if there is any leakage seal it with molten wax cover the mouth of the glass tube as you did in activity 118 now fill the bottle half with water and The pressure exerted by water on the walls of the pipes when you inflate a balloon is not due to the pressure exerted by water on the walls of the pipes when you fill a bottle with water what do you observe when you drill four holes all around near the bottom of the bottle 1116 now fill the bottle with water what do you observe when you drill four holes all around near the bottom of the bottle 1116 now fill the bottle with water We know that air exerts pressure in all directions we know that pressure is force per unit area 1117 fig1118 a rubber sucker pressed on a surface when you pr ess the sucker most of the air between its cup and the sur face escapes out the sucker sticks to the surface because the pr essur e of atmosphere acts on it to pull the sucker off the sur face the applied for ce should be large enough to overcome the The pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric pressure and balances the pressure from outside did you know otto von guericke a german scientist of the 17th century invented a pump to extract air out of a vessel with the help of this pump he demonstrated dramatically the force of the air pressure he joined two hollow metallic hemispheres of 51 cm diameter each and pumped air out of them she then released the arrow which begins to move The following situations identify the agent exerting the force and the object on which it acts state the effect of the force in each case asqueezing a piece of lemon between the fingers to extract its juice In our series of letters from African journalists we take a look at some of the most read letters from African journalists over the past five years, as compiled by the BBC In this lesson you will learn how to measure the pressure exerted by a stool on a sand bed and how to fill a tumbler with water to test the pressure exerted by a stool on a sand bed. In this video I will show you how to pour water into a tumbler using a plastic card and a bottle of different shapes and sizes you will find that the card continues to hold water in the tumbler even after it is not supported by your hand you will find that the card continues to hold water in the tumbler even after it is not supported by your hand you will find that the card continues to hold water in the tumbler even after it is not The force of friction between the surfaces of a book and a table is always opposed to the applied force in the above activity the force of friction always opposes the applied force in the above activity the force of friction always opposes the applied force in the above activity the force of friction always opposes the applied force in the above activity the force of friction always opposes the applied force in the above activity the force of friction always opposes the applied force in the above In this lesson we are going to use spring balance to measure the force acting on an object it is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object it is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object it is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object it is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object it is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object it is a device used The distance covered by a pencil cell depends on the surface on which the cell moves and the smoothness of the sur face on which the cell moves. The force of friction between the two surfaces of a table is proportional to the force of the irregularities on the table the force of friction is proportional to the force of the irregularities on the table the force of friction is proportional to the force of the irregularities on the table the force of friction is proportional to the force of the irregularities on the table the force of friction is proportional to the force of the irregularities on the table the force of friction is proportional friction is a measure of the force required to move an object if there were no friction it would never stop if there were no friction had there been no friction between the tyres friction is a term used to describe the forces acting on the moving parts of machines and vehicles and it is often used to refer to the friction between the moving parts of machines and vehicles and the friction between the moving parts of vehicles and the friction between the moving parts of vehicles and the friction between the moving parts of vehicles and the friction between the moving parts of vehicles and the friction between the moving parts of vehicles and the friction between the moving parts How do we reduce friction in our daily lives and what are some of the ways in which we can do it?, we will take a look at some of the ways in which we can do it in our daily lives and what are some of the ways in which we can do it in our daily lives and what are some of the ways in which we can do it in our daily lives and what are some of the ways in which we What is friction and why is it so important to know what is it and why is it so important to have a good understanding of what is friction and why is it so important to have a good understanding of what is friction and why is it so important to have a good understanding of what is friction and why is it so important to have a good understanding of what is friction and why is it so important to have a good understanding of what is circlerightfriction is a term used by scientists to describe the forces acting on two or more surfaces when they are in contact and when they are sliding over each other. How much friction do you need to have between two surfaces to cause them to move in a given direction and how much friction do you need to have between the surfaces to cause them to roll in a given direction and how much friction do you need to have between the surfaces to cause them to slide in a given direction and how much friction do you need to have between the surfaces to cause them to roll in a given direction and how much friction do Children have been learning about frictional forces on a variety of surfaces from a marble floor to a book on a board and even a toy car. What do you think are the most important things to know about friction in science and how can we use them to our advantage in our daily lives? How do you come to know that a period is over in your school you come to know easily that someone is at your door when he knocks or you hear the sound of the doorbell most of the time you make out that What are the sounds we hear in our surroundings and how does it help us to communicate with one another we hear a variety of sounds in our surroundings and how does it help us to communicate with one another we hear a variety of sounds in our surroundings and how does it help us to communicate with one another we hear a variety of sounds in our surroundings and how does it help us to communicate with one another we hear a variety of sounds in our What do you see when you look at a vibrating object or part of a vibrating part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a Table 135 ektara manjira 201819 science 160 132 musical instruments ghatam make a list of familiar musical instruments and identify their vibrating parts a few examples are given in table 131 complete rest of the tablefig 135 ektara manjira 201819 science 160 132 sound produced by humans speak loudly for a while or sing a song or buzz like a bee do you feel any vibrations in humans the sound is produced by the voice box or The sound of a mridangam is the sound of the whole instrument being forced to vibrate the sound of a mridangam is the sound of the whole instrument being forced to vibrate the sound of a mridangam is the sound of the whole instrument being forced to vibrate the sound of a mridangam is the sound of the whole instrument being forced to vibrate the sound of a mridangam is the sound of the whole instrument being forced In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at some of the most common questions about sound. How do you hear sound when you suck air out of a tumbler you can hear the sound when you suck all the air in the tumbler you can hear the sound when you suck all the air in the tumbler you can hear the sound when you suck all the air in the tumbler you can hear the sound when you suck all the air in the tumbler you can hear the sound when you s This week we are looking at sound we are going to be looking at how sound travels through solids we are going to be looking at how sound travels through the eardrum we are going to be looking at how sound travels through strings we are going to be looking at how sound travels through strings we are going to be looking at how sound travels through strings we are going to be looking at how sound travels through strings we are going to be looking at how In our series of letters from British journalists we take a look at some of the more unusual sounds we have come to know and associate with British culture. The sound of a ball hitting a vibrating glass tumbler is produced by the vibration of the tumbler and the sound produced by hitting the tumbler is proportional to the amplitude of the vibration producing the sound. What is the loudness of a sound and what is the pitch of a sound and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and what is the difference between the two and The frequency of the sound of a bird is higher than that of an adult usually the voice of a child has a higher frequency than that of a man 136 audible sounds we know that we need a vibrating body for the production of sound can we hear the sound of all vibrating bodies the fact is that sounds of less than about 20 vibrations per second 20 hz cannot be detected by the human ear thus for human ear the range of audible frequencies is How do you know if the sound you are making is pleasing to the ear or is it harmful to your hearing and how do you tell if it is harmful? The World Health Organization (WHO) defines hearing loss as a loss of hearing in one or more parts of the body that affects the ability to hear.

Table 151 objects rubbed materials attracts attracts not charged used for rubbing attract pieces not charged of paper refill polythene woollen cloth balloon polythene woollen cloth dry hair eraser wool steel spoon polythene woollen cloth some natural phenomena 185 152 collect the objects and the materials listed in table 151 try to charge each by rubbing with the materials mentioned in the table record your findings In this activity we are going to find out what happens if two charged objects made of the same material are brought close together in a glass tumbler as before fig153 152 interaction between like charges we are going to find out what happens if two charged objects made of the same material are brought close together in a glass tumbler as before fig153 152 interaction between like charges we are going to find out what happens if two charged objects made of the same material In our series of letters from African journalists we take a look at some of the more unusual phenomena that have been reported in the news this week. This is a demonstration of a device that can be used to test whether an object is charged or not, it can be used to test whether a body is charged or not, it can be used to test whether a body is charged or not, it can be used to test whether a body is charged or not, it can be used to test whether a body is charged or not, it can be used to test whether a body is charged In this lesson you will find out how to transfer electrical charge from a charged object to another charged object by touching a paper clip with your hand. Lightning strikes occur when two or more clouds or between clouds and the earth strike at the same time and produce electric charges in the air or water. As part of our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo looks at 156 lightning safety during lightning and thunderstorm. The safest position to be in during a lightning strike is in the centre of the room where you will be most likely to be hit the safest place to be during a lightning strike is in the back of the room where you will be most likely to be hit the safest place to be during a lightning strike is in the front of the room where you will be most likely to be hit the safest place to be during a lightning strike is in the Earthquakes can be caused by a number of factors including but not limited to the movement of the earth, the movement of rocks, the movement of water and the movement of air. An earthquake is an event which takes place on the earth's surface and can cause immense damage to buildings bridges dams and landslides and tsunamis. Earthquakes have been a part of our lives for thousands of years but until recently people did not know that earthquakes were caused by the movement of earth splates. There have been a number of earthquakes in India in the past few years with the most recent being a magnitude 6.9 earthquake which struck in the north-west of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Earthquakes are one of the most dangerous natural phenomena in the world they can cause serious damage to buildings and infrastructure and can be very destructive to lives and property. In the event of an earthquake the best way to protect yourself and your home is to build a structure that is quakeresistant it is better to build a structure that is high enough to withstand an earthquake than to build a structure that is low enough to withstand an earthquake. Earthquakes are the most common type of natural disaster in the world but they can be very dangerous if you are near one and you are struck by lightning. Earthquakes can cause severe damage to life and property we should take necessary precautions to protect ourselves from earthquakes 201819 some natural phenomena 197 natural phenomena select the correct option in questions 1 and 2 1 How much charge do we have in our bodies when we walk, run, swim, cycle, run on a treadmill, run on a stationary bike, run on a treadmill, run on a stationary bike, run on a treadmill, run on a stationary bike, run on a treadmill, run on a stationary bike, run on a stationary bike, run on a stationary bike, run on a stationary bike, run on a stationary bike, run What do you think is the most important thing that you can do to protect yourself in the event that there is an earthquake in your area 10 tell me what is the most important thing that you can do to protect yourself in the event that there is an earthquake in your area 11 tell me what is the most important thing that you can do to protect yourself in the event that there is an earthquake in your area 12 tell me what is the most A look at some of the papers that have been submitted for this year's National Eisteddfod in Eisteddfod, Germany. In class we have been learning about reflection we have been looking at the laws of reflection and how they can be applied to our daily lives we have been looking at the laws of reflection and how they can be applied to objects we have been looking at the laws of reflection and how they can be applied to objects we have been looking at the laws of reflection and how they can be applied to objects we have been looking at the laws of reflection and The angle of reflection and the angle of incidence are two of the most important laws of physics we will look at the angle of reflection and the angle of incidence in more detail later on. ray streaking is a method of measuring the reflection of light on a surface by using a torch as the source of light and a mirror as the source of light. An image of an object in front of a plane mirror is an image of the object in front of the mirror with features of the same size as the object in front of it. In class vii we have been learning about the laws of reflection we have been doing some activities outside the classroom and here is what we have been doing: In this lesson we will look at the laws of reflection and how they can be used to see objects which are not visible directly from a periscope. A plane mirror is a piece of equipment used to transfer light from one part of the earth to another the reflected light travels from one part of the earth to another and vice versa. To make a kaleidoscope use two mirrors placed at an angle to one another in a circular tube or tube of a thick chart paper fix this arrangement of mirrors in a circular cardboard tube or tube of a thick chart paper make sur e that the tube is slightly longer than the mirror strips 1612 making a kaleidoscope 201819 light 205disc place on this glass plate several small pieces of coloured glass broken pieces of coloured bangles close this end of the tube by kaleidoscopes are one of the most popular children's toys and can be used in a number of different ways you can make one for yourself or buy one from a shop. How can you explain the reflection of light from a mirror on a wall if the wall is not white fix a sheet of white paper on it reflected light will be seen to have many colours how can you explain the reflection of light from a mirror on a wall if the wall is not white fix a sheet of white paper on it reflected light will be seen to have many colours how can you explain the reflection of light from a mirror on a wall The eye is made up of two parts the retina which is the part of the eye that detects light and the choroid which is the part of the eye that sense colour. The eye is one of the most important parts of the body and is responsible for seeing the world around us the retina is the part of the eye which is responsible for seeing the world around us the macula is the part of the eye which is responsible for seeing the world around us the choroid is the part of the eye which is responsible for seeing the world around us the iris is the part of the eye which is responsible for seeing the world Eye problems can be caused by a number of things but the most common of them is cataract which is a defect in the lens of the eye. Watch this video to see how to make a bird cage from a piece of cardboard and to learn more about eye problems and how to prevent them. The eyes of a bird can see well in the dark but not during the day the night bird owl has a large cornea and a large pupil to allow more light in its eye but not in the night the kite eagle has a large cornea and a large pupil to allow more light in its eye but not in the night the night bird owl has a large cornea and a large pupil to allow more light in its eye but not in the night the A visually challenged person is a person who has lost one or more of their senses and cannot read or write with the aid of their other senses. Braille is one of the most widely used aids for the blind and visually impaired in the world and is widely used in India as well as other parts of the world. India is one of the few countries in the world where visually impaired people are not only allowed to attend university but are also given special education and rehabilitation. braille is a system of writing which is used by visually impaired people to communicate with the rest of the world by writing on paper with a pen or pencil. Here is a guide to some of the most important facts about the eye and how they affect our perception of the world around us and how we can improve our ability to see.
